Compared to the danger of a polling station, it's absolutely hypocritical no arguments to be made that going out to protest was an objectively greater danger to public health.Relative to spending 20 minutes at a polling station where you can implement social distancing requirements much easier than overhauling the entire administrative structure that would be required to make mail in voting valid, it seems a no brainer which is the better metavaluation with regards to public safety and election legitimacy.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,1

But let me push back on this philosophy of yours. We can't prosecute people for thoughts because we can't read minds and we can't know which thoughts will be acted on. But we can prosecute people for planning to commit crimes. And what is a plan if not complex thinking? You haven't committed the crime yet, how can you criminalize the thoughts?",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,233
238,238,tombolger,31/07/2020,11:29:24,">And what is a plan if not complex thinking?Great question. When prosecuting a criminal for a planned crime, it's very rarely done just as a planned crime and not as part of a larger prosecution. Usually someone has enacted part of a crime and the prosecution seeks greater charges by attempting to prove that the defendant had greater plans and intent, for example, possession of a hundred kilos of heroin usually implies an intent to distribute.However, if it's ONLY a plan, truly, it actually cannot be prosecuted because in attempting to convict someone for an incohate offence, the prosecution would need to prove the defendant had mens rea, which without any actions, would be absolutely 100% impossible to do. You'd have to at the VERY least communicate your plan to someone else (out loud or in writing) which is a physical act of conspiracy, and that's potentially criminal, but that's more than just a plan, that's an action toward a plan. If you make a plan and do not act, it's unprosecutable. Even if you wrote it down on paper in detail, the defense could easily claim it was a fantasy and the defendant had no actual intent to proceed. I've fantasized about hurting people I was angry with in my life before, usually when I was young and full of hormones. Should I be in jail? No, because I used my better judgement, and that's a quite normal experience. Who hasn't thought ""I'm gonna punch that guy!"" and decided not to?>how can you criminalize the thoughts?So you still can't. Inchoate offenses still require some action or another to be prosecutable. >Actions flow from thoughts.Actions flow from decisions. Everyone has emotions and thinks thoughts they'd rather keep private because they don't reflect their actions or real character. This is because the thoughts don't matter. It's like dreams, if you have a crazy dream you'd never ever act on in the night, like a dream of cheating on a spouce or killing someone, those are still your thoughts, but you decided better. The decisions are what count. And speaking or tweeting is a decision, an action, and Trump's words can make a lot of impact on lives.

I've fantasized about being a dictator before, what sort of good I could do if I didn't have to deal with the democratic process and people bickering. That isn't evil or a problem, it doesn't make me a bad person. But if someone like Trump who actually has power says that that stuff out loud (or tweets it), it can be a real problem.

I know these growth time frames are going to be followed up by crashes because our economy is fueled on consumer debt. Eventually consumers are going to start defaulting and paying off debts in mass which leads to crashes.We are already at near 0% interest rates and already were at massive deficits during a sustained period of signifcant GDP growth during the past 5 years which isn't supposed to happen as deficits are supposed to shrink during economic booms due to increases in tax revenue and decreases in spending on things like unemployment.

Trump immediately declares that the voting was rigged, that there was mail-in ballot fraud and that the Chinese were behind a plan to provide fraudulent mail-in ballots and other ""election hacking"" throughout the four key swing states that gave Biden his victory.3. Trump indicates this is a major national security issue, and he invokes emergency powers, directing the Justice Department to investigate the alleged activity in the swing states. The legal justification for the presidential powers he invokes has already been developed and issued by Barr.4. The investigation is intended to tick down the clock toward December 14, the deadline when each state's Electoral College electors must be appointed. 5. All four swing states have Republican control of both their upper and lower houses of their state legislatures. Those state legislatures refuse to allow any Electoral College slate to be certified until the ""national security"" investigation is complete.6. The Democrats will have begun a legal action to certify the results in those four states, and the appointment of the Biden slate of electors, arguing that Trump has manufactured a national security emergency in order to create the ensuing chaos.7. The issue goes up to the Supreme Court, which unlike the 2000 election does not decide the election in favor of the Republicans. However, it indicates again that the December 14 Electoral College deadline must be met; that the president's national security powers legally authorize him to investigate potential foreign country intrusion into the national election; and if no Electoral College slate can be certified by any state by December 14, the Electoral College must meet anyway and cast its votes.8. The Electoral College meets, and without the electors from those four states being represented, neither Biden nor Trump has sufficient votes to get an Electoral College majority.9. The election is thrown into the House of Representatives, pursuant to the Constitution. Under the relevant constitutional process, the vote in the House is by state delegation, where each delegation casts one vote, which is determined by the majority of the representatives in that state.10. Currently, there are 26 states that have a majority Republican House delegation. 23 states have a majority Democratic delegation. Even if the Democrats were to pick up seats in Pennsylvania and hold all their 2018 House gains, the Republicans would have a 26 to 24 delegation majority.11. This vote would enable Trump to retain the presidency.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,500

In the House, House rules control how each state delegation is to be counted. The House sets rules for how each state's delegation is to be counted. For example, from wikipedia:""Historically, a delegation that did not give a majority of its vote to any one candidate was marked as ""divided,"" and thus did not award its vote to any candidate. This practice, set by House rule, was responsible for turning the Jefferson–Burr election of 1801 into a multiple ballot election. It was not a factor in the 1825 contingent election. The House could modify the rule for future contingent elections if it so chose. ""The House can change their rules so that rather than a majority vote, a *unanimous* vote is required for a state's delegation to count. Any state's delegation that doesn't reach a unanimous vote is then disregarded. Thus, the vast majority of states will not have any votes counted, as only states with entirely Democrat or entirely Republican delegations will cast unanimous votes. The House will thus be deadlocked and unable to choose a new president. Second, the Vice Presidential election can also be disrupted. 2/3rds of Senators are required to form a quorum. Democratic Senators can simply refuse to go to Washington, denying a quorum. Third, some exploitation of the line of succession takes care of the rest. After failing to elect the new president, the House elects Biden as Speaker of the House. (Anyone can be the speaker, not just seated members of Congress.)

America was founded on violence, and it's the very threat of it that keeps everyone under control.The closest thing to actual gun control legislation we ever had was when a bunch of minorities in California marched with firearms in the 60s. That was largely due to racism, though the bigger takeaway is that it was the threat of violence being twisted back against the side that often employs it. Yet the only lesson that people seem to have learned from that since is just 'California is the most liberal state in the US and that's why it happened', without stopping to consider *why* it happened.It's clear that at this point in history, there's too many guns out on the streets to believe that any kind of measure to reduce their numbers is anything but impractical unrealistic fantasy land, especially when the NRA's gun manufacturers have the power to flood the streets with even more firearms and ammo, the moment that even a *whisper* of it is suggested in order to perpetuate that feedback loop. It seems the best thing that can be done now is to support measures that advocate for responsible training in the use and maintenance of said firearms, so that the people aren't subjected to *mindless* violence. But people on both sides seem to drown that out with absolutist rhetoric, because owning guns in general got twisted into a divisive political issue where one side is conditioned to believe that any kind of regulation on firearms is an attack on their personal freedoms, and the other side is conditioned to believe that anything related to owning firearms at all is a sin.It's kind of like mail in voting and climate change. Both of them really shouldn't be political wedge issues (and *aren't* political wedge issues in most other countries), but they somehow got transformed into one under our disgusting political apparatus. One because of theoretical demographic data, the other because of lobbyists.Oh, about what happened with gun control in California in the 60's? It was called the Mulford Act, and the passage of *that* was actually *super bipartisan* and was *supported by the NRA*. Democrats held the majority then, but only by a super slim margin of like 1-3 members.https://www.history.com/news/black-panthers-gun-control-nra-support-mulford-act",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,1118

Democrats were opposed to the war, and their platform was a negotiated peace with the south - ether to re-enter the union as before, or breakoff as part of a planned process. Either way, Democrats wanted the war stopped, and nominated former General George McClellan as to run against Lincoln, his former Commander-in-Cheif. The Democrats thought that McClellan, being such a prominent General, would convince voters that the war couldn't be won without massive bloodshed, and it was just better to let them (the south) leave. After Sherman and Grant started delivering [big] victories, the North saw it could win the war if they just kept the course, and re-elected Lincoln. After the war, the Republicans in the north had huge political capital, since they bet on the right horse and won. Democrats however, were seen as southern sympathizers and capitulators. Since they couldn't grab seats from northern Republicans for the aforementioned reasons, they went down South during Reconstruction. They played to the poor white base there, and stoked racial tensions. Southerners liked this and voted for them. Democrats then used this political power to end Reconstruction and help usher in the era of Jim Crow.About 75-100yrs later, they'd switch again, with Democrats dropping the racism and supporting the labor class. Republicans would take advantage of the power gap and embrace their opponents former supporters, continuing the racism, but also adding sexism and other divisive qualities, in order to gain more southern support.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,1258

No.  Each state runs its own election.>What about people that insist on voting in person? Will they be able to? Safely? With no lines taking hours?That doesn't even happen when there isn't a pandemic, but some states will undoubtedly do better than others.Here's how it works, going backwards from Inauguration:* 6: On January 20, 2021, one minute past noon, the next President of the United States is sworn in.* 5: On January 20, 2021, at noon, President Trump's term ends.* 4: During the first week of January, Congress (the 435 members of the House and the 100 members of the Senate in a joint meeting) receive reports from all 50 states and the District of Columbia telling them how the votes for President turned out.* 3: January 3rd, 2021, Congress is sworn in.  That's all 435 members of the House, and 33 new members of the Senate.* 2: On December 14th, the 538 electors of the electoral college meet in their respective state capitols.  Each state transmits these votes to Washington DC* 1: On November 3rd, each state (and DC) hold elections for President, Congress, and a number of other seats.  The winners of the Congressional elections will be sworn in on January 3rd.  In the Presidential election, people are not voting for a President directly, but are instead voting on which delegation of Electors gets to cast votes for their state.  Using Michigan as an example: each state party has a list of 16 people (mostly party officials) who will be electors.  If Trump wins the votes of a plurality of Michigan voters, then the 16 electors on the Republican Party list go to Lansing in December to vote.  If Biden wins, the 16 people chosen by the Democratic Party go to vote on December 14th.So here's the thing: Step 6 will happen, no matter what.  Step 5 will happen no matter what.  Step 3 will happen, no matter what.The President has absolutely zero control over the national election.  If some states decide to postpone (or even cancel) the election at Trump's request, the rest of the states will still hold their elections.Most of the states will do #1.The states who did #1 will have selected the electors who meet in #2Every state that goes through #1 and #2 will have results for Congress to tally in #4.  The states that don't hold an election effectively abstain from casting votes in #4.In the very, very, *very* unlikely chance that we get to #4 with fewer than 538 electoral votes cast (because some states never held an election and never sent electoral votes to Congress), then the votes from those states will, quite simply, not matter.  The last time something like this happened was the election of 1864, when eleven states did not hold an election for United States president, because they did not consider themselves part of the United States.  In that election, every non-Confederate state chose electors, and the electors voted.And in the very very very very *very* small chance that every state decides to cancel or postpone their elections, Donald Trump's Term still ends on January 20th, and the Speaker of the House (Probably Nancy Pelosi) is sworn in as the next President until such a time as Congress meets and carries out step #4.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,1320

The states control the election in their state (meaning they control how the election is ran, how the votes are counted, how they declare the winner, and they select the electoral voters to go to the electoral college), but the date for the vote is set by Congress, per Article 2, Section 4: ""The Congress may determine the Time of chusing [sic] the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States"" So Congress change the day to vote, and they choose when the electors are sent to the Electoral College: ""When no certificate of vote and list mentioned in sections 9 and 11 of this title from any State shall have been received by the President of the Senate or by the Archivist of the United States by the fourth Wednesday in December, after the meeting of the electors shall have been held, the President of the Senate or, if he be absent from the seat of government, the Archivist of the United States shall request, by the most expeditious method available, the secretary of state of the State to send up the certificate and list lodged with him by the electors of such State; and it shall be his duty upon receipt of such request immediately to transmit same by registered mail to the President of the Senate at the seat of government.""So it is possible for Congress to delay the election and delay the real election (Electoral College), but they have a hard set date: ""The terms of the President and the Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.""So they would be required to have the votes done by January 3rd, because after that date the entire house would no longer be elected and would mean there is government body to take in the electoral college vote. But the states do have the right to send someone to congress as an emergency candidate, so even after January 3rd the house could be seated and they would vote for President (and the Senate the Vise President). But since there are more Republican majority states in the house (and Senate) the vote would effectively make Trump the President.Now here is the problem for Trump: He cannot postpone the election even with the emergency powers act. If he tried, and please god let RGB still be alive, the Supreme Court would not approve it.

Some of them fear social changes (police reform, helping the unemployed), unfairness (""How come I make less money than people at home?""), having to follow rules (see: Covid), immigration, and some just fear anyone non-white being helped. None of his voters seem to say ""he's doing great at this thing right now!"" (though many have fallen back on ""the economy was good before covid!"" ignoring that if Trump had been proactive, covid would be over and the economy returned to normal already).

They want someone who beat down their enemies, even if their enemies are just people exercising their constitutional right to protest.

If they think cancel culture is bad now, Trump has just paved the way for republican protestors to be kidnapped by DHS, beaten down, run over, and shot (they usually carry weapons to protest, after all) under democratic leadership that doesn't scale back presidential powers.

Also, that's what Putin wants.In 1997, a Russian political scientist named Aleksandr Dugin and a serving Russian General named Nikolai Klokotov sat down and wrote a text that would become the foundation of Russian geopolitical strategy over the next 20 years. It was called “Foundations of Geopolitics” and it was all about how Russia could reassert itself in the world.For the U.S., the book mentions: ""Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics""I honestly don't know how a country cuts off all misinformation, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and brainwashing from a voter base that now seems to identify solely by these things. And it's so many people. It's 40% of the country. At this point, Fox news could air ""the next civil war started today and it's time to take action"" and I honestly think all of their viewers would start loading their guns, even if nothing had actually happened at all. That's how blindly 40% of the country is being led around by the media.We could start teaching kids critical thinking skills, media literacy (checking for credible sources), and how to deal with their emotions (to eliminate the effects fear-mongering), but 40% of the country's parents would think ""they're brainwashing my kid to be a liberal!""Fuck.

TL;DR I tried really hard to believe and realized community was the feeling religion creates, and it can be found without the doubt and pressure to suspend disbelief)I feel this deeply and personally. I grew up in the south, and when we finally moved into an active neighborhood, in a house we'd be in for as long as possible/necessary, I was just old enough to start making friends. Befriended a girl just a few months older than me, who lived two doors down. Her family invites me to stay over for a sleepover after a few months of our families getting along. They weren't super religious but they were big on tradition, which included going to church every sunday. They make sure to check with my parents for permission first, but also made sure I wanted to go and wasn't pressured. When I asked my parents if they were going with us, they firmly and politely said no and that they wouldn't discuss it further until I was old enough to have that conversation. Just letting me know that while they don't believe in it, they wanted me to check things out for myself and make my own decisions. I spent the rest of my childhood and most of my teenage years caught between total disinterest, and longing for community/acceptance. I didn't go to much as a kid except for vacation bible school during the summer, which I begged to do because it was mostly a bunch of fun activities with bible things tacked on. As a teen I tried harder to get into it, but it never sat well with me. I was always a question asker and always very critical of ideas and people. Which didn't sit well with the youth pastors, who constantly tried to convince me to let it go and try to open my mind/heart to the teachings. Which I did try to do, so hard. Even went as far as getting ""saved"" and sharing my testimonial a bunch of times. I would do youth activities with the teen youth groups, and go to my friend's churches... but at the end of the day it was literally just so I could spend time with people who I thought I liked, and who I thought liked me (and in many cases both were true, but mostly my welcome extended as far as my belief in their religion). I was very conflicted and not living truthfully for myself by spending so much time trying to fit into something I just didn't have much or any faith in. I'd get swept up in the moment. In the rapture of the vibes that are generated in that environment, and think I was feeling it... I wasn't. I was feeling a gathering or community expressing intention and sharing their energies, and once that became clear I realized I could find that other places. It's easy to see why someone could get locked into christian faith by circumstance or because they're affected by the feeling I was describing above..... But if you even kind of start to pick at it, it eitehr falls apart or becomes hard to stick with. You have to suspend all disbelief and just feel, even when your mind is screaming ""this is bullshit, ask questions! They don't have answers!"". Some people can't shake the need for that feeling of communal energy exchange, and don't recognize that's what they're feeling and not the holy spirit.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,1922

But they would constantly talk about how they needed all this money to get their church on a TV Broadcast and pass the plate multiple times during service.  And every Sunday the pastors family would all pull up in sparkling Cadillacs dressed to the hilt, lots of jewelry and makeup, and their congregation was clearly less affluent.

They were large congregations, and there was plenty of money in them because I live near a large international corporation and everyone either works for them, or for companies that do. The one in my neighborhood definitely pushed to right below mega church status, but the ministers/pastors weren't overtly balling out. They lived very well and had nice things but weren't flashy or boisterous in their physical appearance and attitudes. However the things they built/developed for the church were. The other churchs I visited most were very, very humble and not finanically focused. They only asked for money for mission trips and to make improvements to the facilities, and never in ways that weren't absolutely necessary. I was lucky to have a positive experience with those people compared to what other baptist congregations go through.The Lutheran church I hung out at for non church activities was definitely the one that was most appealing to me, but I was already at the point that I'd decided for myself. They were extremely kind and understanding and didn't mind at all that I was a non believer but would come to their youth functions with friends from school, and would be a part of everything but the religious aspects. They only tried to reach out to me a few times and were very nice and earnest about it, and after the second or third time they came by my house to check on me (after not seeing me for a few weeks/months) and I made it clear that I wasn't interested in joining the congregation, they let it go and still welcomed me with open arms.

2312,2312,Quickski,30/07/2020,13:02:21,"I call that election fraud. It’s important because “voter fraud” is used as a rationale for disenfranchising suppression tactics. If we conflate the two, people could say maybe there is a good reason for stricter voter suppression laws because we know fraud does happen (we have an example of fraud). But this is election fraud of a different kind that voter fraud measures don’t prevent. Voter fraud (a person intentionally voting under the wrong name, at the wrong precinct, or more than once) is very rare and the laws meant to prevent it overwhelming have the effect of suppressing legitimate votes without significant reduction in illegitimate votes (because there aren’t any).Edit- election fraud is also much more likely to change the outcome of an election than voter fraud. GOP policies to stem voter fraud intentionally conflate the two types of fraud to suppress legitimate votes that statistically would skew dem while at the same time failing to address the election fraud which in principle doesn’t favor either party but in recent history has been committed more by GOP campaigns (as far as we know publicly)",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,2310

Second, if by 1000 times worse you mean investigated a very real interference into our elections that was very clearly, if not directly cooperated with, welcomed by and then ignored by the Trump campaign, then sure, it was 1000 times worse. Then, in the course of investigating the legitimately suspicious actions of the campaign, Trump and his associates openly openly obstructed the investigation as much as they felt they could.If anything, it seemed as though Trump did as much as he knew he could get away with knowing that Republicans had no spine and would never vote to convict him no matter how ""concerned"" they claimed to be. He did so to make the Democrats look ""unhinged"" and ""1000 times worse"" to rubes like you who ate it up.I don't think Russia influenced the election as much as we'd like to believe they did, I think this country is sick and it would've voted for Trump with or without Russia. Trump isn't the disease he's a symptom. The Russia narrative was silly to latch onto not because it wasn't true - it's clear that it was and it's very likely Trump's campaign knew about it and encouraged it. They openly engaged in the same divide and conquer tactics. No, the reason it's silly to me is that it allows us to blame an enemy for 2016 rather than point fingers at ourselves. It's easier to talk about Russia than it is the inherent racism and lies this country was founded on. It's easier to believe that Russian interference pushed us to the breaking point rather than discuss how we put ourselves in the position to be pushed there in the first place.You probably won't read this far down, and if you have I'm sure you disagree with every sentence in this comment because you live in a fantasy world.

(to illustrate how narrowly “treason” has been construed in the US: there was an early treason clause case (involving aaron burr, in fact) where defendants had conspired to overthrow the government by force, including making provision to recruit troops for that purpose and drawing up plans to march on DC, but the court found treason charges would be unconstitutional because it interpreted “levying war” to require an “*actual* assemblage of men with treasonable design” — i.e., it isn’t even enough to “conspire to levy war,” one must actually be in the process of actually making open war on the government.) this doesn’t really seem to fit. edit: clarity",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,2653

But the problem for Trump is - there is nothing in the Constitution that extends his term in that case. The Presidential Succession ACt would come into effect, and with no House (and thus no speaker of the House) the President Pro Temp (basically a ceremonial position up until now - picked by the majority party - which would be Dems in Jan 2020 if R states didn't hold election) of the diminished Senate becomes temporary president until the election can be held.2. The SC says - tough luck - the law and Constitution specify when electors must be named, when Congress is sworn in, and when the electoral votes are counted. Since you only need a majority of electors ""appointed"" then Biden probably wins. If not then it goes to the House to pick the president, but they likely wouldn.t ha a quorum.

If you are unable / can't be bothered to apply for an absentee ballot, then go to a polling place. If you can't be bothered to do that, then don't vote and accept the outcome. >As with all forms of voter fraud, documented instances of fraud related to VBM are rare. However, even many scholars who argue that fraud is generally rare agree that fraud with VBM voting seems to be more frequent than with in-person voting. Two of the best-known cases of voter fraud involving absentee voting occurred in 1997 in Georgia and Miami . More recently, a political campaign manager within North Carolina’s ninth Congressional district defrauded voters by collecting unfilled ballots and then filled in the rest of it to favor the campaign’s candidate, leading to a new election.https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voting-mail-and-absentee-votinghttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vote-by-mail-ballot-counted-election/https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/21/18231981/north-carolina-election-fraud-new-nc-9-election",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,2761

It would be pretty obvious if people were not getting their votes and found out that they were cast for them. Trump mentioned fake ballots by a foreign entity. That's virtually impossible by mail because every single ballot in every city is different and they would need the entire country's voter roster.

Their ""church"" do not need to accept them or welcome them. Hypocritical to their original doctrine, yes, but they do not need to. The church can also deny to hold marriage ceremonies to them.

But if I am a Christian who believes homosexuality is an abomination, then I cannot sincerely congratulate you or wish you a happy marriage. That’s why their “acceptance” is a superficial display without actual empathy.Ultimately, the issue is simple. It doesn’t matter if you claim to love gays or not, or if you vote for gay rights or not (well it matters but not in this context); if you think homosexuality is a sin then you are discriminating against gays, you are homophobic and hate gays either explicitly (like fundamentalists do) or implicitly (like the “liberal” ones do).",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,3438

The most liberal interpretations though are fairly benign, although yes, ultra rare.For homosexuality, the most liberal interpretations see it as a sin but not a ""choice"". Because ultimately no matter what we do we are inherently sinful by nature due to the fall.This means no matter how many good works or good thoughts, you lose unless you accept Christ. And the fixing of any sin is handled in the afterlife. It's nlt important *WHAT* sin you commit, just that you recognize you're fucked without Jesus, and try to live a good life.So if you're gay, get married to someone you love, adopt kids, be loving. In the afterlife god handles the rewiring of your brain and although these interpretations don't claim to know how it is resolved, you and your partner will be together forever in eternal love......... they just don't know how sex is handled lol. Because there are plenty of awkward scenarios to think of in the afterlife. Oh you were married twice because spouse died??? What happens in heaven? Eternal 3some? Not really fair to the first spouse right?These same types respect separation of church/state. ""Render unto ceasar what is ceasar's"". It's unfortunate more American Christians don't enter modernity but there are interpretations that I, as a secular humanist don't mind.P.S.- Adventists don't believe in hell.

3449,3449,senseibates,30/07/2020,15:46:55,">But they are still racists because they believe blacks should not do something everyone else can simply because they are black.The difference is that sex has a biological function shile race doesn't. In other words, being a swingers couple is a sin. Premarital sex is a sin, and those are choices. Sexual orientation and race are not choices. Sex is for pro-creation and bonding with a loved one. There are plenty of non gay scenarios which are harmless, but Christians still claim aren't what god intended.>Imagine a religion that thinks black people marrying the ones they love is a sinRacist Christians already went with this in the past. But from liberal interpretations I've seen, the problem is interracial marriage already happened in the Bible multiple times. So it's already condoned and fits with a functional perspective of sex.>The most liberal interpretation still sees it as a sin thoughIt's religion. You don't like the religion, that's fine. But the charitable liberal interpretation is that sex serves a function, pro creation. Meaning sex that can't lead to children isn't what was originally intended. It's not that gays are bad, it's that their ""useless"" procreatively speaking.So if you're a straight couple that's infertile god ""fixes you"" in the afterlife. If you're gay, god ""fixes you"" in the afterlife. In either example you aren't a bad person, but you are ""flawed"". Race does not serve a pro creative function so it's an invalid comparison. And the flaw IS NOT YOUR LOVE, it's the *utility* of the relationship. And as I said, these Christians don't claim to know the ultimate details of the plan, just that part of it includes procreation.This god could just as easily make men capable of having children. Or could eliminate sex as the primary method of creation, which would mean humans can procreate another way. Ultimately gay people don't have a monopoly on potential awkward heavenly scenarios. It's not their love for each other that needs fixing and they wouldn't be barred from loving. It's the procreative aspect.Given the sexual process already installed, it's reasonable to assume that heterosexuality would be part of the solution. But it's ultimately unknowable. My problem with your insistence that these people hate gays is your willfully misinterpreting the argument.If god hated gays for not being able to have children he would also hate infertile people. I think religion is flawed, and there is no god.

My god created sex so that white people can fuck and have fun and procreate with their married SO, not for black people to have fun. So the flaw isn’t that they’re black, it’s the utility of their relationship. I never said blacks are bad, nor did I say blacks should not love others, all I’m saying is blacks should not fuck.

There IS NO INHERENT FUNCTION to race.There is an obvious function to sex, which is pro-creation. This is acknowledged by evolutionary biologists and theists. It's almost as if everyone but you understands there is a function to sex. A function race simply has no correlation to. But I'll roll with your bullshit.>My god created sex so that white people can fuck and have fun and procreate with their married SO, not for black people to have funLOL. Hi, I'm also a member of your hypothetical religion. Thought I might clarify the hatred your spewing. It looks like OUR god created sex so that white people could procreate, and black people are having trouble pro creating. In fact it looks like there's some mysterious medical ailment which causes the amount of melanin in your skin to affect your reproductive system despite your skin and reproductive organs being completely seperate organ systems. That's unfortunate. Black people shouldn't miss out on the ability to create life since it's one of life's greatest joys. I think he'll eitherA) Turn them white since there seems to be some sort of biological connection between UV radiation, melanin, and reproduction. That way they can pro create.OrB) Allow them to remain black and give them the ability to procreate. Although since black people are missing Ovaries, a Uterus, and Vaginal tract that might be difficult for them to adjust to.OrC) Seperate procreation from sex altogether. If he gets to speak things into existence, I'm sure there's a way for him to give humanity a new method that doesn't cause immense physical pain to one gender......WHOOPS,  I mean one race. I'm guessing it'll be C, since procreation shouldn't be painful. But it could also be A.  For some reason I don't think B is likely. I'm not racist. It's just that since black people lack functional reproductive organs because the UV light which increased melanin seems to obliterate vaginal, uterine, and ovarian development..........they might feel really weird about their insides being rearranged.Who knows. What I do know as a member of this hypothetical religion is that god is loving and wants the best for everyone so we'll find out which solution works best anyway.

Take the pandemic away, and it seems you could solve this problem by raising the minimum wage to a living wage. No one on assistance is getting rich from it. Many are required to keep their total wealth under 2k, just to keep their benefits. These people are absolutely barred from saving, which prevents them from home ownership, investments, providing for their children’s future, and so much more. These people’s lives are not easy, they are not cheating anyone out of money, THEY are being cheated by a nation that promises life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. You want to be mad about people sitting on their asses, getting rich off of doing nothing and cheating the public? Look at our billionaires, hoarding their wealth offshores, avoiding taxes.

These places happened to be hundreds of miles in some cases from minority voting districts and not open every day of the week.Kobach, the GOP's voter fraud darling was going from state to state hyping up his plans to instill fear of ""voter fraud"" in all their Red Voters and was even given a commission in 2017 to investigate it.But this was a commission that was supposed to be bipartisan to some extent, and the Democrats on the panel were not being given the underlying information behind Kobach's loud proclaims of rampant fraud discovered.The Democrats sued and won their case to see their own panels documents and Kobach IMMEDIATELY closed the panel and issued a report that revealed that they actually HADN'T found massive voter fraud.BTW the tales of voter fraud convinced about a half dozen GOP voters that it was so rampant that they needed to vote twice to cancel out the Democratic cheaters.    They were IMMEDIATELY caught and confessed, each one. Not understanding that it wasn't a widespread, hard to catch crime.See, voter fraud doesn't impact or swing large elections because it's almost fucking impossible to get away with.Ballot Harvesting of Absentee ballots like the GOP did in one of the Carolina's even got caught - but that's Election Fraud.  A different crime, and one that's not solved by VOTER ID laws.The fact of the matter, is that unless you're mailing EVERYONE their voter ID for free, you're imposing a poll tax.  And even then, you're making it harder than necessary for the Homeless to vote.  And as citizens they have as much a right as anyone.But it is interesting that you bring up voter ID and ignore the gerrymandering proposals that were exposed when the architect of the GOP plan died and his daughter released the files.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,3414

Your second point glosses over the fact that usually these ""Dead People Voting"" are the elderly that mailed in an absentee ballot and then died before the election.  Again, that's not voter fraud.    To vote in almost any election you need to identify yourself.  To commit massive voter fraud on a national scale would require millions of people to coordinate and vote multiple times across different regions without getting caught.  Yeah, it's impossible when you figure that there was a massive commission that was looking for exactly that and found almost nothing.  It's a non problem.  And hey, there you are saying ""Both Sides"" and ignoring that I detailed a GOP Strategy that was part of the PARTY POLICY, and not just a small faction here or there, where gerrymandering was the point.  Whole cities ending up blue or red has almost nothing to do with gerrymandering.  A city having a slice taken out of it's population and diluted with a massive group of rural voters like in say Austin?  That's Gerrymandering. And it isn't done on the city level.

Mail-in voting is one of the best ways to provide fair access to the most amount of people. No lines, no polling stations closed in your community, etc. - Even houseless people or those without a traditional address can access a ballot (e.g., Oregon rules: “Voters must provide a residence address on the voter registration form, but this address may be any definable location in the county that describes their physical location. This could be a shelter, park, motor home, or other identifiable location. The mailing address of a person who is homeless or who resides where mail service is unavailable can be the office of the county clerk. Voters can pick up their ballot at the county elections office.​“)- It is a felony to fill out someone else’s ballot, and if your signature doesn’t PERFECTLY match, your ballot will be rejected, so fraud is nonexistent.

What they do have the ability - but not the authority - to do is for Pence to refuse to open the electors' letters in the Senate on January 6 and tabulate the results that determine who the President and Vice President will be. However, if they do that then, per the Constitution, he and Trump would automatically cease to occupy their positions on January 20 and then, per the presidential line of succession, Pelosi would become President.  But let's just say for the sake of argument that no elections happen on November 3. What happens then? Well, all of the House and one third of the Senate are up for election that same day. So, come January 3, when the new Congress is required by the Constitution to assemble, there would be no House and a smaller, Democratic-controlled Senate. (More Republicans are up for election this year than Democrats.) Come January 20, Trump and Pence would become regular civilians and, per the line of succession, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate - the leader of the majority party in that chamber, i.e. a Democrat - would become President and the process of sorting out the mess in the House would probably be fought in the courts.  How about another scenario, where some or all of the states whose governors and legislatures support Trump find a way to stop their elections? Well, the other states would continue theirs, which would by implication mean that there would be a *massive* Democrat majority among those electors' letters for Pence to open on Jan 6.

5199,5199,whistleridge,30/07/2020,11:23:58,"US Constitutional Law 101:  1. Presidential elections are hard-wired into the constitution. Article II, section 1, clauses 2 and 4, to be exact.  2. The timing and execution of the election is up to *Congress*, not the President:  > The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.”  So at most, all he or any other President can do is ask nicely.   3. And even if Congress wants to say yes (hint: this one does not), there is still a strict time limit:  > The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows: [a long clause discussing how states appoint Electors]”  4. And while Congress would be free to vary the Election Day as they saw fit, it has been set by law since the Presidential Election Day Act of 1845 as:  > The electors of President and Vice President shall be appointed, in each State, on the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, in every fourth year succeeding every election of a President and Vice President.”  In practice, that means Election Day hasn’t been earlier than the 2nd or later than the 8th since John Tyler was President, there were 27 states in the union, and Texas wasn’t one of them. This Act has not been updated since 1948. So there’s a LOT of precedent here.  5. As a matter of logistics, a US Presidential election is an enormous undertaking. In an absolute emergency - think nuclear war, not a virus - Congress might vary the date by as much as 2-3 weeks, but not more. Not and meet the constitutional deadline. And neither they nor the President has any legal authority to extend their terms of office.   6. The Democratic Party controls the House, and Nancy Pelosi wouldn’t change the Election Day for anything short of a giant meteor strike. Certainly not to please a President who is largely trying to do so to duck the consequences of his own incompetence.   7. This is part of the system of checks and balances. Presidents don’t have the slightest say in their own terms of office, deliberately to head off this sort of maneuver.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,

I mean sure, the power rests in Congress to actually make any of this real, and sure it's written into the Constitution that he cannot delay the election, but he's also done some really amazing amount of damage to our country's institutions.  How this all shakes out is going to reveal exactly how much damage he's done running around inside our government with a flamethrower and sledgehammer (or rather letting loose people that will use said tools for maximum damage, don't want anyone to think this man would ever do something akin to exercise, it would break his carefully crafted image.)  Relevant questions:  1) Does the Senate put a bill on the floor to vote to delay the election? This will be very telling.  2) Do Republicans try to push the ""delay the election"" narrative into the courts? Do they push it up to the Supreme Court?  3) Do they try to replace more judges on the court? Get some that have voted against Trump to step down?  4) How is the Post Office holding up these days?

It is an open question if one of these lawsuits hit the SC how they will rule, if they rule against the Constitution, what then?  Like say they decide the pandemic is circumstances enough to actually circumvent the constitution and delay the election? It would be an unconstitutional ruling, sure, but who is going to exactly stop them?  Alternatively, say Trump loses the election and declares it was rigged anyway and sets up armed guards to protect himself, drag the election into the SC again and they rule in his favor?

Slightly misleading in that it sounds like this is some new thing just this year.  Voting has been primarily by mail in Colorado for years and it works really well.  Every registered voter automatically gets a ballot.  Mail delay and/or postage cost isn’t a problem because we’ve also got dedicated ballot drop boxes all over the place.  I put my email address on the envelope and a few hours after I drop it in the box I get an email confirming my vote has been counted.  Even using the drop box I’ve never waited in a line.  The panic from Trump and his hangers-on is really funny from the perspective of someplace where this has been the default and works just fine.  What they really mean, and don’t forget it, is that the GOP has spent decades (and millions) trying to restrict access to polling places in areas likely to vote against them, and mail-in voting undoes all that.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,

He gets Fox News and the Republican propaganda machine to normalize the idea of the election being a “fraud” and vote by mail being easy to defraud. His base is a bunch of brainwashed idiots so they’ll do whatever he says. All they need is a talking point, something simple to rally around and repeat over and over again. “Vote by mail is easy to do election fraud” was that talking point, and they were successful at pushing that narrative.   Then he sabotaged the USPS and made them delay packages across the country. They’ve been slandering and lying about the USPS for years, and especially so in the last few months, and forcing them to enact changes that hamper their ability to deliver mail in time. A 2 day priority mail package took 2 weeks for me. They’re trying to get public opinion against the USPS and make them think that that the post office can not cope with the increase amount of mail due to covid.    Now that Fox News and the right wing propaganda machine has normalized the “voting by mail leads to fraud” and right wing voters have rallies behind it, they can now begin the push to normalize the idea of postponing the election (indefinitely). Fuck that.   Republicans have already committed so much election fraud that any attempt to explain it takes forever. They already disenfranchised so many minority voters that any attempt to describe takes an overwhelming amount of time. Both will undoubtably be met with gishgalloping.   Republicans are traitors to this republic. I hope everyone involved is investigated, taken to court, found guilty, and served the maximum punishment.   All we have to do is open as many poling places as possible, make a *huge* push for early voting, enact strict social distancing measures and require masks and gloves to vote, sanitize the voting booths after every use, and of course encourage vote by mail. The same vote by mail that we’ve used without problem for year.   Republicans are traitors who act in bad faith. No attempt at offering any reasonable safety measures will be met with agreement. These people should be called out every single time. Law firms should be on standby and preparing cases.   *If* god forbid that the election is postponed, Donald Trump and Mike Pence should be forced to abdicated the office in January on their last day. The speaker of the house should assume the role of president and select a Vice President until they election is administered. If it appears that an election postponement is in order, Democrats should make a massive push to do just this. If not the speaker of the house, then the Supreme Court should administer it.    *Always* bring up “what if Barack Obama did this?

6384,6384,tim310rd,30/07/2020,18:33:57,"There would be nothing illegal about changing the date of an election. It has happened in the past, in 1845 Congress restricted the dates on which the presidential election could be held from a 34 day period to a 7 day period, more specifically the first Tuesday after the first Monday in October. There has been movements for years now to change the date of voting as many people have to work on that Tuesday. A shift of election day also probably would not change inauguration day, as that happens more than two months after the election. He also would not be able to do this without congressional support. Personally I'm on the fence, mail in voting could be a safe alternative, but I worry that most states don't have the infrastructure to conduct a mail in system accurately (as in up to date addresses, and personnel to ensure that the process is free of interference), and seeing how many counties across the country are operating at a deficit and going into debt, I don't think they could get all of this up and running in time for the election. Also, many people across the country will soon be homeless due to not being able to afford rent, and shelters will undoubtedly be overcrowded quickly. How do we represent their vote? In normal circumstances these people constitute a very small segment of the population, but now they could be a significant voting block that would have little representation. Not to mention the number of people that will be changing their address frequently in the coming months, or the number of people who have died either due to coronavirus or suicide that may still have ballots mailed to them. Again, not dismissing the idea entirely, it could very well work, but I'm not sure about that under these specific circumstances.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,

When questioned about it by friends, I explained it was due to his rhetoric and populism. They argued he was an idiot and most people were too smart, and then I pointed out what Carlin did a good while back: think about how smart the average person is, and then realize that half of the people on the planet are less intelligent.  It's easy to fall for rhetoric when you're stupid. But more than that, even an intelligent person can fall for it if they are worn down. Even further, malicious intelligent people exist, and would gleefully go for it.  My friends pretty much shrugged me off, assuming a Dem win, and went about their lives. When he did win, conveniently, most of them remembered me saying any of that.  After he was in office and started in, I warned many of those same friends that he was a proto fascist at the time. He was testing waters and learning how to flex the new muscle he had. They again shrugged me off, saying he wouldn't be able to do anything too bad but he's screw up enough he wouldn't get a second term. I said ""If that happens, he will refuse to leave, he'll come up with something."" And they shrugged me off again.  A couple of years ago I again warned my friends, but this time that he had passed the tipping point and was actively pursuing fascist ends. This time they agreed that he was a proto fascist, but they were trusting in the checks and balances that were supposed to protect us. I explained that they were already not working, but they refused to listen.  Then the virus. At first, I said it was going to be mishandled on a national level. They said the states and the people would offset any mishandling, and when I pointed out that was unlikely to happen just due to already existing unrest, they shrugged me off. Now that it's happened that way, they aren't really saying much other than complaining about the mishandling of it by both the people and the government.  Now, the protests. I pointed out that Trump would use it as justification for federal officers to start pulling exactly what they are doing in Portland. When something similar on a smaller scale happened in D.C. I pointed out that it was absolutely a testbed scenario. They didn't believe me. When it started in Portland, I pointed it out as a phase two testbed, and they didn't believe me. Now there are talks of doing it elsewhere.  We are now at the point where the checks and balances are so broken, they will most likely not work, yet I see a lot of friends, a lot of news outlets, and a lot of people here talking about those same checks and balances like they will stop him. They almost assuredly won't. Please stop assuming they will, that's been a huge reason for things getting this bad, those assumptions.  I say all of this because I *know* I am not the only one that had an experience like above. Even some of the most stalwart anti Trump people I know we're arguing against the things I said. I know many others experienced that same phenomenon. I also know that most of us likely didn't want to be right.   Everyone, and I do mean everyone, that has a problem with this situation needs to call their representatives in their state. All their representatives, local, county, and state. Flood them with complaints. Our representatives are really our only chance at this point",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,

That's not even listing everything else on his site. He'll basically make it to were only those with financial means can own firearms.  Hell, the last one (online purchases) alone should be a no go. I recently purchased a GP100, that's a 6 shot revolver. My lgs didn't have it and neither did their seller. I was able to find a FFL in another state to purchase from online. They sent it to my lgs for the FFL transfer so I was able to get it. No ammo available for it so once again ordered a case online.

The Constitution states that the term is four years. You would need a Constitutional Amendment for Trump to remain in office without him being re-elected.   So if there is no election, then Trump and Pence would no longer be the President and Vice-President on  January 20, 2021. It wouldn't necessarily be Pelosi, either, since she is up for re-election as well. The term of every member of the House of Representatives ends on Jan 3, 2021. Now, the state legislatures and Governors can appoint their state's US Representatives until the next election so once they do that then the House would once again elect a Speaker, and then on Jan 20, 2021 that person would become the President. Odds are it would be Pelosi, but no guarantee.  So if the election is cancelled then the most likely scenario is Pelosi would be the President until an election could be held.

If there's no congressional elections, all congressional terms will also expire on Jan 3rd, 2021 (and all Senators who should have been up for election), so there will be no Speaker of the House.  There will still be Senators (because the Senate has 6 year terms so only 35 are up for election in 2020), so the [Senator pro tempore (currently Republican Chuck Grassley)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate) would be next in line to become president.    Note the Senate Democrats would control the new 2021 Senate by 35 (including 2 Dem caucusing independents) to 30 starting January 3rd, and these Democratic senators would elect a new Senator pro tempore.  Traditionally, it would be Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy as since 1890 it has been given to the Senator with longest service record of the current majority party.

So previous Presidents had the veneer of civility but were pretty incomplete human beings too. Or pieces of shit following the winds wherever they blow. It's hard to tell. But it certainly has uncovered how rotten the system is. How little we really advanced in the last 50 years or so.  So the systems that produced both Trump and Hillary / Biden and all the other shits are still there, very much intact. You simply can't create a new party without a really drastic event. The entire right is still one unified block. The only reason Trumps numbers are at like 40% is because of high unemployment, not because of the covid response itself.

8839,8839,Desos0001,02/08/2020,05:53:52,"Fun fact hilariously if somehow the election doesn't take place before January 3rd some wild things actually happen because that is when elected members of congress are supposed to meet and begin their new session. So get this:  As such by January 20th if no election has been held the Senate would then be able to appoint a new President Pro-Tempora to act as President since constitutionally Trump and Pence would end their terms on January 20th, 2021, at 12:00 pm.  Typically at this point with no President or Vice President the next in line to serve till an election is held would be the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. Get this though, they're up for re-election in 2020. So they would not be in office still, so the next person would be the President Pro-Tempora who would be Senator Chuck Grassely Republican, which is the majority party in the Senate.  If the election is delayed to that point though, on Jan 3rd 2020 things get interesting. Of the 100 Senators in Congress 35 are up for re-election those seats would remain vacant till the election happened or till they were filled by their respective governors.

Whatever he says that puts this issue in the spotlight, I'm for it.   However, the election does need to be on Nov 3rd, and  mainstream media has a responsibility to make this the center of their attention.   On the media side, they need to highlight the shortage in poll workers and highlight states that are not properly prepared to count thousands of extra mail in ballots on election day. I almost wish there was a media truce and they work together to get Americans to register to work the polls and or be watchers at county absentee counting centers. Then on election day,  all election coverage is media personalities from both sides of the spectrum like Jake tapper and Sean hannity running a polling place together.  On trumps side. Talk is cheap. Okay we heard you. What are you going to do about it? You are all mister states rights and let them handle covid, so if you want the states not to do mail in ballots, how can we get the states safe polling places? How can we get more Americans registered to work the polls?  How can we make sure polling places are not closed down? I don't see mister art of the deal here. I see someone whining about something he doesn't like, when he has ultimate influence to make something happen. Stop with the conspiracy theory stuff and get shit done.

They just announced they purchased the extra equipment that would have allowed them to finish their absentee counts by the close of the polls election day. We r set for November. Where you are from. Set, ready to go for November. Other states though? Back in April, states declared they were allowing mail in ballots. That takes a lot of prep time but the process was rushed.

I understand some worry over the process of the mail in ballot process (mainly relating to confirmation), but it's not something that will destroy the election. And even if it was as currently deployed, he could approach it with a way to address those concerns rather than trying to disregard any attempt at implementing such. It's a partisan hit job, not a rational policy proposal. And his ""question"" about delaying the election? Something he has no power to do, since they are state elections? Clearly an attempt to influence his own supporters to doubt the election process and results. Or at the very least, just to get a rise out of Democrats.

So they started checking the mail in votes (they only check mail ins if it could influence the election, ex. If one candidate is winning by 100,000 votes and there's only 80,000 mail ins they won't check them to save time) and about 95-99% of the votes mailed in were for the same candidate. Now I'm not saying there was fraud, but it's pretty sketchy if over 90% of the mails voted the same way in such an incredibly tight race. I don't think the election should be pushed back at all, I disagree with that 100%. But I do think that there needs to be VERY tight security on mail ins and extra precautions because I wouldn't put it past either group trying to cheat to win the election",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,

Well both of course not happening, neither the delay nor me being US-American yet it was a suggestion again.   My political views are probably around slightly conservative and open to moderate liberal views. When I see the equivalent of that political party in the US I see that they took it to the extreme with the candidate D.J Trump... I don’t disagree on a moderate conservative stand, would even speak positively of such a stand if foreign political leaders were to hold such views as long as they are moderate and open to collaboration. Both of those being absent in Trump. The disrespect he brought Merkel for example is just extremely undiplomatic, going from his attitude when meeting up to the way he talked about her. Trump also made collaboration very difficult with Europe which is again a thing I can not agree with. Ever since he thought to go undiplomatically into Europe agreements, I really hoped that he’d not get re-elected. You might not see it where you are but the outside world in general holds similar opinions of your president, him being undiplomatic, disrespectful and overall not what we used to know from American leaders. Wether that leader was republican or democrat, they always saw allies as allies and even if opinions differed, mutual respect was present. The thing with the delay on election is showing once again that he has no respect for nothing, not even his own constitution. It’s quite shocking that so many people over in the US don’t see how he turns out to be such a propagandist and undiplomatic leader... When I see what he does and continues to do you just have to ask yourself one day if a man who is under so much critique form within and outside is not maybe someone who is a problem. Now you can tell me about liberal media control or whatever Trump says to defend himself from critique, it remains that the man can not be as holy and perfect then some think. A perfect being doesn’t exist. In his case, he is far from that.  Now you’re right that I have no effect on US politics, I can’t vote nor run for a fonction, but my opinion is mine and that’s what I think.

9595,9595,flick41611,30/07/2020,13:52:00,"I am confused about the outrage over this. This whole discussion centers on a couple factors that I think everyone can agree on:   1. We all want a secure election, where the results are reliable and we have high confidence that the results are legitimate.   It is widely known and understood that foreign adversaries manipulated the last election process. It is therefore a reasonable assumption (and I think evidence is already showing? I don't have a source for that, but I think I've read something) that those adversaries would try to influence this election as well. 2. The most secure way to vote is in-person. It is much harder to impersonate someone or submit multiple votes in person. But with the pandemic raging, there is greater hesitancy to gather lots of people in a confined, indoor space to facilitate in-person voting.  It is important to ensure the security of the election, so that there is high confidence in the results. It is also important to ensure the safety and health of those voting (and those facilitating the voting). Those things appear to be in conflict with each other this election cycle, due to the pandemic. So what to do?  The answer du jour seems to be expanding mail-in voting. I haven't done much research on the logistics of this, but it seems on its face that it would be fairly easy to manipulate a mail-in voting setup. What is in place to ensure that each person submits only one ballot? If I get my hands on 5 ballots and submit them all, would there be a process in place to catch that and disregard the additional ballots? And if there are truly bad actors trying their damndest to manipulate the election, what would prevent someone from exploiting this on a massive scale? And if there is a process, how scalable is it if 80-100 million people are submitting mail-in ballots? These are genuine questions that I don't know the answers to, but are important to clarify if there is going to be widespread mail-in voting.  On its face, Trump's messaging assumes that mail-in voting is inherently not secure, and delaying the election would allow for more time for the pandemic to peter out and for people to go to polls without fear of spreading the virus. I suppose the cynical view is what the media (like the BBC article) is speculating; namely that Trump is just leaning on this as a way to unfairly stay in office. We all know (and Trump does too) that he doesn't have the authority to unilaterally delay the election. That's why we have checks and balances in place.  My request is for information that explains the process behind mail-in voting. Is it secure? What is in place to prevent widespread manipulation of the process? I am all for making voting more accessible and safe for people, but it is also important to ensure that we don't make the system too easy to exploit and manipulate.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,

On the other side, after following trump for 3 years as president, he loves to suggest things so if the plan doesn't go accordingly, he can say he never said such a thing and if the plan goes forward, he can claim he always wanted to do so in the first place. I feel a good number of supporters like this about him. So when i read constant news of him suggesting something, I know this is what he wants to do.

Let Donald propose his delay and let it be voted on and believe in the power of your democracy to choose what is in the best interest of the people.

Or he’s not incredibly stupid but it floating incredibly stupid ideas to distract from the economic state of the country.  It’s as simple as this: in nearly every instance of a strong economy, a first term president is re-elected. It’s one of, if not the, most important re-election factors. Despite trump being a widely unpopular president, approval ratings being around 45% or less throughout his term, Trump has a lot of positive talking points on paper. Historic lows for unemployment, Obamacare insuring people at historic highs, a very strong economy, etc. Arguably, for or against, these aren’t the byproducts of a Trump presidency. Nevertheless, statistically, it would lead to a likely trump reelection.  That’s, arguably, why Republicans have pushed so hard for the economy to stay open down the homestretch to election 2020. On the flip side, I can assure you that, even if it isn’t the primary motivation behind their rhetoric, it would probably be accurate to state the many democratic politicians are giddy about the economic situation this close to the election. At the end of the day, even if one party does a better job selling it, neither party cares about anything but maintaining power. Because power translates to money in their pockets. They don’t care about you. They don’t care about your small business or your house. They don’t care about anything but their own financial interests.

When you say ripped off, I guess you mean times where the party that didn’t receive the amount of money they wanted got mad at trump, when it was perfectly in his legal right to do what he did in that business dealing. If Donald trump actually stole from people, he would have been arrested. His dad gave him a fraction of what he has now, that is well documented, what his dad gave him was around a million, but now he has billions, how can you explain that?

Then that increased to 15 people and he said it would disappear. He refused to wear a mask until a couple weeks ago, arguably politicizing wearing a mask (see many of Trump's supporters being those without masks). He consistently lies about US Covid statistics (see the interview he did with Chris Wallace on FOX). He continues to attempt to hold rallies where you have thousands of people in an enclosed area (see the Tulsa rally). In fact, Herman Cain just died from Covid today, after attending that rally (not confirmed that he got it there but it seems pretty coincidental with timing). He was a businessman and Trump supporter who tweeted before the rally, ""Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!"". I'm sure there are way more examples of how this has been mishandled, but those are the first couple that came to mind.

It doesn’t matter who was President, we were going to get hit hard by it. Could he have gone about it differently, probably, but I don’t think it would’ve made much difference. And since the media hates Trump, they’re magnifying the failure, like if this wouldn’t be happening with Obama or Clinton or anyone else.",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,

I see your point about getting hit hard no matter the leadership, but it makes me think about other countries and how they’ve been hit with similar circumstance but with different leadership.  2. I’m always curious about this whole hating on the media thing. Like sure the opinionists and talking heads of both sides are going to offer their slant, but numbers are numbers. The death toll and economic repercussions of lousy leadership are hard to point at and call false.  3. This is a more minor point but, it’s both ~a virus like we’ve never seen before~ and a ~magnified failure~? So is it an unprecedented shit storm or an overblown fart?",Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election,neutral,
