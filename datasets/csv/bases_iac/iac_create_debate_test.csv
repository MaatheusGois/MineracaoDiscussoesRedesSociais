Weather or not to ban guns.;neutral
The answer is obvious, if we do ban guns wouldn’t criminals be the only ones who are able to have guns and citizens would not be able to have access.;negative
I am clearly against banning guns in order for self to defend and protect my rights as a citizen.;negative
If the law were to come in affect the wiliness for others to protect themselves or to have security upon danger would be difficult.;neutral
The ban of guns will more likely create a whole new victim group.;positive
It would prevent legal gun ownership but it wouldn’t prevent illegal gun ownership.;neutral
Gun crimes with illegal weapons are commonplace.;negative
"If police can use weapons to defend themselves from criminals; wouldn’t you want your own protection as well?";negative
Criminals and gangs are able to still have access to illegal guns, and to ban guns from honest citizens is taking a privileges they earn in order to protect themselves and their family.;positive
Gun owners have the advantage to combat and survival.;negative
If the ban of guns were to come into affect, gun owners now would doubly turn in their weapons.;negative
The real question is would you be safer if guns are banned.;negative
In Washington and New York there is several gun controls laws but yet these two are ranked high in having the most murders, Washington being the murder capital of the United States.;negative
Especially now a day, terriost attacks and incidents have been happening all around the world lately and to be prepared and protect is the key to any good turn out.;negative
In conclusion, overall banning guns wouldn’t be the best step in our government it will cause a huge controversy and will more likely create a whole new argument.;negative
It wouldn’t stop the access of illegal guns and I think that’s been the focus should be on.;negative
It would prevent legal gun ownership but it wouldn’t prevent illegal gun ownership, which is the problem.;negative
It depends on what country.;neutral
I think gun control should be a thing, but on certain conditions.;neutral
If someone has no history of mental illness and no criminal record beyond drink driving and the occasional parking ticket, than by all means allow them to purchase a low-powered rifle or pistol.;negative
The issue arises when people can have multiple weapons registered to them, when in places like the United States have this gun culture, and when proper control of the sale and distribution of weapons is not properly cared for.;negative
With all of these school shootings throughout the United States in the past few years, I think guns are the issue.;negative
Not the entire issue, obviously, because you can have a hundred guns, but it takes a special kind of mental state, stable or not, to be able to kill someone without a very good reason.;negative
All of the people responsible for mass shootings and murders will usually have some sort of severe mental problem.;negative
However, it's this gun culture that the United States has that makes it all slightly more okay than it would be in most other countries.;neutral
Guns should not be banned in the United States, or indeed anywhere.;negative
People keep guns for hunting and for recreation, and protection, among other things.;positive
However, this gun culture means that someone will have eight guns, two sons with major mental issues and an entire community perfectly willing to go hunting without a single worry.;neutral
With the gun culture that the States has, it all seems a little easier when someone wants to go on a murderous rampage.;negative
That's why most other countries have so few in comparison.;negative
If it's issues with population, look at China.;neutral
So, I think guns should definitely be controlled, especially in the United States.;negative
However, I can understand that people can use guns for recreation, hunting and sport.;neutral
So, I think that people should be allowed to have guns on the condition that they have no mental issues or history of violent crime, and that none of their immediate or close family or friends have them either.;negative
Then, with this sort of control implemented, there should be a lot less shootings throughout the United States.;neutral
There is too much gun violence in America.;negative
It has been going on way too long.;negative
It is time to have strict gun control in this country.;neutral
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
Exactly only the people who disobey the laws will be the only ones with guns.;neutral
not if they cannot buy them ...;neutral
That's right, all criminals get their guns through legal means right now, so more laws will work.;negative
I know right .;positive
I know right.;positive
So true.;positive
The problem is that people think criminals just get their weapons legally and fairly.;negative
They will produce them.....................................................................;neutral
ah yes because common criminals can easily produce guns.;neutral
They will get it from someone who can make guns cheaply.;neutral
The only thing it does is hurt law following people.;negative
who can produce guns cheaply ?;neutral
:D;neutral
you don't actually think they get them legally right.;neutral
That is the problem, they don't just go to the gun store and buy them, they steal them or get them from the black market.;negative
Some even get them from out of the country, but that isn't as much.;negative
Bullshit, they just buy it from guy on parking lot who brought them 10 minutes earlier from a registered gun store;negative
Ok.;neutral
Keep believing what you want.;positive
All criminals will do things the right way and will never resort to anything illegal.;positive
I't not matter of belief it works in the UK 40x less gun deaths... so :D;positive
Yes but also in the UK the police don't even carry guns, which is kind of dumb.;negative
Also, there are more gangs in the U.S. I am sorry but most criminals will find ways around it.;negative
Criminals get guns illegally, banning them would only make the people who get them legally suffer.;negative
not truth, in the UK is 40x less gun crime per same number of people, so strict gun law works.;negative
US/Somalia like gun laws doesn't.;negative
Then why would banning them be a good idea?;neutral
Think before you post stupidity.;neutral
It greatly reduces shootings of all kind, crime related to it, it saves a huge amount of money.;negative
The United States has the most violent crime involving firearms in the entire world.;negative
They aren't the highest-populated country in the world, nor do they directly suffer from the most war or the most oppression, and they still have the biggest gun problem and the most deaths from firearms.;negative
More people are killed in home invasions by guns they keep in their home, and most teens shoot up a school because of a combination of mental issues and weapons their fathers keep in their home, or that of a friend.;negative
Second Amendment, baby!;negative
.;neutral
"Yes make it so people can be controlled by the government more great idea ;)";positive
Guns shouldn't be banned because then the people who follow the law won't be able to protect themselves from the ones who don't.;negative
what about UK?;neutral
40 times less gun crime ... so fuck you :D;negative
Think about it.;neutral
It's not the 60s anymore.;negative
Thousands or Russians aren't going to go marching up the street and slaughter your family.;negative
Most shooting deaths in home invasions are caused by the guns of the owners, taken by the burglar, either when they have found it in their house or when the owner of said gun has tried to protect themselves with it and had it turned on them.;negative
Sure, even if guns are outlawed violent crime will not stop.;negative
But it will still be the same amount of violent crime, less home invasion deaths and less school shootings.;negative
Like I said, think about it.;neutral
US/Somalia like gun laws doesn't.;negative
Loads of debate raging after the mass killings in the past few months;negative
on one side are those who want to ban autmatics and semi - automatic assault style weapons that fire multiple bullets per minute...some also want to tighten the application process for gun licenses;negative
on the other side many americans point to the second amendment and claim it entitles them to buy and use and weapons they like;negative
then theres some in the middle of the road who believe in the second amendment right to bear arms but simply think the 200 bullets per minute assault weapons should be banned and only available to soldiers;negative
the crime figures are interesting;positive
obviously gun murders in america are way higher per head than any developed nation in the world (11000 ddeaths compared to european nations who average around 40 per year in total);negative
but pro gun people point that other crime stats are often higher in some of these other nations, such as robberies , common assaults, etc;negative
so what do you think?;neutral
I doubt the founding fathers who wrote the 2nd amendment were thinking about the kind of guns we'd have in 2013.;negative
It's time to update the Constitution to clarify what the 2nd amendment means today.;neutral
I am sure when the Founding Fathers wrote the first amendment they didn't think about the possibility of the Internet and how much hate speech could end up on it.;negative
It's time to update the Constitution to clarify what the 1st amendment means today.;neutral
If the first amendment is outdated that is your opinion.;negative
The point if the first amendment is that you can't be punished for anything you express because it doesn't harm anyone, I could say the most racist hateful bigotted crap on the internet.;negative
How does it hurt anyone.;neutral
They didn't predict the internet and if that changed thing where free speech could physically hurt someone or negatively affect someone with the exception of them getting their feelings hurt then how is the first amendment outdated.;negative
This can be comparing apples to oranges depending on the argument as to why the first amendment needs to be revised and the 2nd amendment.;negative
You shouldn't be punished for owning a gun because owning a gun doesn't harm anyone.;negative
I could own a hundred assault riffles and people around me would still be safe.;negative
How does it hurt anyone what I own?;neutral
"Except for the fact that people who are for gun control get their panties in a bunch ;)";neutral
How is the 2nd amendment outdated?;negative
you shouldn't be punished for owning a gun cause owning a gun doesn't harm anyone;negative
How do you define punishment?;negative
By this sentence you and me have different defenitions of punishment it seems.;negative
I could own a hundred assault rifles and people around me would still be safe.;negative
Not necessarily if you have no safety training.;negative
Or are a criminal/psychopath who bought their guns from a gun show.;neutral
It doesn't necessarily, whether or not anyone who is able to purchase guns are fucked up in the head or a hardcore criminal or untrained with access to higher grade weapons do.;negative
Because guns back then are not nearly as powerful as they are now, also you could legalize every gun in the world it will make practically no difference against tanks, soldiers, and military style aircraft.;negative
Punishment is when I can't have something because someone else screwed it up for everyone else.;negative
Why don't we just punish the criminals?;negative
That's the real problem.;negative
The problem is not people owning assault riffles.;negative
The problem is crazy people.;negative
Figure out how to identify the crazies and keep them from owning guns.;neutral
As far as tanks and military aircraft..., how long have we been fighting radicals in both Iraq and Afghanistan?;negative
And all they have are guns.;neutral
I find a totalitarian government more dangerous than few sick bastards blowing away a couple of dozen people each year.;negative
"But hey, that's just me ;)";negative
punishment is when I can't have something because somebody else screwed it up for everyone else.;neutral
Hey sometimes that is what's fair and is what is necessary.;neutral
I'm not for banning guns so through my point of view as long as you haven't assaulted or murdered someone and have a healthy psyche go ahead buy a gun, it might make things more of a pain in the ass but its worth keeping guns in the hands of the innocents and less off the street.;negative
To be able to capture every criminal and take them off the streets, litterally every single one, would probably cost a lot of tax dollars, more so than some gun regulation.;negative
Otherwise they wouldn't be a problem now would they?;negative
Also It's not just a criminal problem but a mental health one as well.;negative
the problem is not owning assault rifles.;negative
The problem is crazy people.;negative
That is what gun regulation is for, psyche evaluations are a form of gun regulation.;negative
Yes but this is because us genius 'MERICANS have figured out that we are in the wrong here in that fight thus we have no goal of taking them over oranything, just soldiers stuck in a pointless war of self defence that we wrongfully started.;negative
What do you mean we were wrong?;neutral
We needed to test our new weapons and what better place to do it in?;negative
I mean..., those people are very generous to let us practice on them :);positive
The second amendment being outdated is an opinion as well, I guess that makes that line of thinking bad as well.;negative
Why don't don't you tell the family of people who have killed themselves because people made fun of them on the internet that the 1st amendment does no harm.;negative
That is cyber bullying, Idt the 1st amendment covers it (like how you can't yell fire in a theatre) and if it does then the 1st amendment is flawed.;negative
There you go, we have no idea if the 1st amendment should allow cyber bullying.;negative
The wording of the first amendment says that some forms of cyber bullying are ok, doesn't that mean we need to update the 1st amendment to account for new technology?;negative
If that is the case then yes it does.;neutral
The 1st amendment is outdated and should be improved upon.;negative
I whole heartedly agree.;positive
Of course this depends on the defenition of cyber bullying.;neutral
Are you on drugs?;neutral
Rewrite the 1st amendment?;neutral
It was created for a reason.;neutral
It is timeless.;positive
People need to have thicker skin.;neutral
Our amendments were created to be amended when need be, that is the American way.;negative
The point of our government is to socially adapt.;positive
"The illegalization of alcohol was probably written for a reason and considered ""timeless"" and it got practically removed.";positive
If the 1st amendment allows people to bully others online to the point of suicide then perhaps it needs to be rewritten a little bit differently to not allow such behavior.;negative
"Give me a rational, reasonable, logical refutation against my argument other than accusing me of being on drugs, calling the amendment ""timeless"", and created for a reason.";positive
Of course it's created for reason obviously I'm not saying we should write it out just update it, and timeless is an emotional appeal.;positive
I could say the most racist hateful bigoted crap on the internet.;negative
How does it hurt anyone.;neutral
The is no reason to update the 1st amendment because people can't get hurt with words.;negative
The 18th amendment was passed in the 20th century, so no it was not timeless.;negative
The 18th amendment came about because people couldn't mind there own business and had to control what other people could have, sound familiar.;negative
It didn't work out so well did it?;negative
I could say the most racist, hateful, bigoted crap on the internet.;negative
How does it hurt anyone?;neutral
There is no reason to update the first amendment because people can't be hurt with words.;negative
If people however are bullying someone online with direct insults intentionally meant to make the person feel Shitier and they can't do anything about it then I do think it should be updated.;negative
The 18th amendment was passed in the 20th century, so no it is not timeless;negative
What is your definition of timeless?;positive
the 18th amendment came about because people couldn't mind their own business and had to control what other people could have, sound familiar?;negative
It didn't work out so well did it?;negative
Sounds awfully biased if you ask me.;negative
The point I'm trying to make is whether or not something is an amendment doesn't make a good argument to be preserved.;negative
If your disagreement of the 18th amendment justifies it's ratification, but on the hypothetical situation that the 1st amendment allows people to bully someone online where the bullied can't do anything about it might have me have a slight disagreement with it, doesn't justify my opinion it needs to be updated slightly?;negative
"Also we restrict people from any freedoms, murder can be seen as a ""freedom"" and illegalizing that has done more good then bad in my honest opinion.";negative
The argument that I am taking away your freedom doesn't make a good logic, you need to justify that freedom if I accuse it of intruding on another freedom (where in this case the freedom being intruded on is the freedom to live your life without people harrassing you with hurtful words.);negative
Woah, woah, woah, now you want to add an amendment to allow murder?;negative
Man you are heartless.;neutral
I seriously hope the country doesn't listen to the opinions of someone crazy enough to defend the murder amendment.;neutral
Well since you want to use my own words against me in a dishonest way, and have nothing else to contribute then that tells me I won the argument :).;negative
I am done here, unless you want to debate honestly I will ignore you now.;negative
applauds;neutral
I got you to go against your original argument and then try to claim that murder has a possibility of being a freedom, I won.;positive
You argued against the exact same words you used before, you lose.;negative
Really?;neutral
You failed to use my argument against me.;negative
You were using my argument that the 1st amendment shouldn't be touched before the hypothetical situation of the first amendment allowing harassment against my argument after the hypothetical situation that the 1st amendment allows harrasment...;negative
"Yes murder can be considered a ""freedom"" to some though most don't, the point is anything can, I'm trying to point out you can't compare the freedom of harassing people to the freedom of simply drinking alcohol where appropriate.";negative
You said that the 1st amendment should not be touched, words don't hurt anyone.;negative
What is your current position?;neutral
I win;positive
That was when we were arguing just the 1st amendment, now we are arguing the amendment under the hypothetical situation that it allows harassment.;negative
It doesn't apply.;negative
This is a debate about the 2nd amendment and you are completely off topic, clearly I have beaten you so bad you can't think straight.;negative
We can create laws to not allow harassment without breaking the freedoms set forth in the 1st amendment, there is no need to update it, just like there is no need to change the 2nd amendment.;negative
Maybe we should make it illegal to commit a crime with a gun.;neutral
Thank you for not continuing your crazy stance on freedom to murder, it made you sound like a lunatic.;positive
Oh I'm the only one who's off topic?;neutral
XD.;neutral
I don't want to change the 1st amendment at all because as far as I can tell it doesn't allow the harrassment I am talking about, this was all hypothetical.;negative
If we can create laws against harassment without affecting the 1st amendment, ewe can create laws regulating guns without affecting the 2nd amendment.;negative
Making it illegal to commit a crime with a gun isn't going to solve anything, it already is.;negative
The point I was trying to make to you is that the amendments are there to be adapted when need be, I honestly agree the 2nd amendment should be revised for today's guns.;negative
The 1st amendment isn't causing any problems.;negative
You are so delusional, you already are shown to have tried to twist my words against and yet you still think you win, I'm sorry if I'm winning I wouldn't need to play dirty tricks at all.;negative
Fine ill say you win, ill grant you that satisfaction your delusional mind wants and let the actions speak for themselves.;negative
Can you give an example for how you have demonstrated that you are more qualified than the founding fathers to make these decisions?;neutral
Can you give an example for anyone alive today who has spent the time and effort to really think about what it means to change one of the fundamental principles that the country was founded upon?;neutral
Should we really be making gut decisions about what rights millions of people are allowed to have?;negative
By the way, I played no such dirty tricks, it only seems like that because you lost.;negative
We can't ask the founding fathers whether or not it is outdated can we?;negative
I'm not necessarily more qualified, if they were still around today they could agree or disagree with me as times now are than different back then.;negative
"The founding fathers made the amendments to be adapted when need be, that's why they are called ""amendments"" to amend something means to change, therefore the amendments are supposed to be changing through out history, the reason the amendments by the founding fathers have gone so long untouched is because there brilliance in creating them, but sooner or later times are going to change so much that some amendments won't even apply anymore.";negative
Like the day weapons more advanced then guns comes along and replaces them will make the 2nd amendment completely superfluous.;negative
Sooner or later thos.;neutral
If amendments won't apply effectively.;neutral
If the founding fathers really thought that the people of the u.s. years after there death weren't qualified to update their amendments, why make them amendments?;negative
"Why not put it under a section that says ""founding father's untouchable rules"".";negative
The answer was no.;negative
Don't write blah blah blah, I won't even come close to addressing your question blah blah blah.;negative
What we do in this life echoes an eternity.;neutral
We should really consider the consequences of our actions.;negative
You demonstrate a clear lack of knowledge required to change a fundamental right set forth by the people who founded this country who actually had a vision of what makes a good country to live in.;negative
I know you wouldn't be the one responsible for the changes, but no one has demonstrated that they possess the qualifications that might be needed to make those changes.;negative
That was my answer but my explanation was to your implied argument that came with your question.;neutral
Unless you weren't implying anything which as someone as dishonest as you would be leaving you without an actual point being made yet.;negative
Go ahead make your actual point unless I am right about yur implied argument then I am waiting for you to actually refute my refutation to your implied argument.;negative
Gosh you're such a genius debater completely disregarding my argument and with absolutely no effort of refuting, I kind of doubt you even read it.;negative
Learn how to debate noob... I wasn't as bad as you when I started but you're going to get your ass beaten when trying to debate with others on here.;negative
what we do in life echoes an eternity.;neutral
We should really consider the consequences of our actions.;negative
These are such good points against me man, accussing me of being irresponsible without logic as to why applaudes congratulations, I guess you got me checkmated good sir.;positive
What right do I want to take away?;neutral
I wasn't aware that I wanted to take someone's rights away... Man the things you learn about yourself that apparently only other people know.;negative
I smell a strawman comin;neutral
I know you wouldn't be responsible for the changes, but no one has demonstrated that they possess the qualifications that might be needed to make those changes.;negative
How do you figure that?;neutral
Ooh, let's bold the other guys responses.;positive
You were responding to statements that were not directed at you in any way, they are rules we should live by.;negative
I am trying to stress the importance of thinking about these things not attacking you.;negative
But obviously you refuse to think or read (now I am attacking you).;negative
You want to take away part of our 2nd amendment rights.;negative
If you wanted to update the 2nd amendment to give us more rights that's news to me.;neutral
Do you not even know what it is that you are proposing when you say we should change the 2nd amendment?;negative
And, I didn't even say you wanted to take away rights, I was accusing you of not being qualified to CHANGE the 2nd amendment.;negative
It says it right in the bolded text you quoted, nice reading comprehension.;positive
If we do change the 2nd amendment, which would be a terrible idea, I certainly hope the people involved can read unlike yourself.;positive
I have not observed anything to the contrary.;negative
You can't even address it which leads me to think I am even more correct.;negative
Well, the pot just called the kettle black I see.;negative
The argument that we can't tell what the Founding Fathers would do nowadays, so let's hack up the constitution is ridiculous for 2 reasons.;negative
1) The Founding Fathers left us an entire constitution with all of their beliefs in it and 2) Just because you don't understand something doesn't mean let's rip it apart.;negative
ooh let's bold the other guys responses;positive
That's what people do on here when responding to each other, I don't as much cause I only have my phone do all this on which doesn't allow me to copy and past making it very tedious thus only if the argument is short, I'm responding to one or two sentences, then I feel up to it.;negative
People having to think about their consequences is a given, when you saythat to me I assume that you think I don't know that.;negative
About the whome change/take away thing my bad I guess I read that wrong, I'm willing to admit when I am wrong.;negative
You are the one claiming people aren't qualified.;neutral
What is your defenition of qualified?;neutral
What do you mean when you say people aren't qualified?;neutral
The founding fathers did put all of their beliefs in the constitution, and all their knowledge.;neutral
And I don't disagree with them, at that time I think having guns were much more justified.;negative
However their knowledge about guns is less when it comes to present day is less than the common person's knowledge now, because guns technology has advanced quite a bit since then.;neutral
They also had the beliefs that the beliefs of the constitution should be improved upon when need be, are you against that belief of theirs?;negative
You accused me of not responding to your arguments and then you totally ignored my arguments.;negative
I need to know why it is so important that the types of guns have changed.;negative
We have rules in place to protect us, why should we throw that all away?;negative
There is no evidence that the Founding Fathers believed that the rights that they gave us should be taken away.;negative
There is a system to add amendments which are supposed to give us more rights not less.;neutral
How many amendments have been modified after being accepted?;negative
"""A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""";positive
When they wrote this, they had no idea what guns would become making gun regulation complicated.;negative
Those against the regulation of guns argue that the right to bear arms says that it shall not be infringed upon, but we have no reason to think the founding fathers wouldn't have tooken inconsideration some of the unnecessarily powerful guns for the public, and we can't bring them back to life.;negative
If the founding fathers didn't want it to ever be a possibility that the bill of rights be updated, why make them as amendable as the future amendments that came?;negative
The Founding Fathers only intended for extra rights to be added to the constitution through the amendment process, and since updating the 2nd amendment would remove rights the Founding Fathers would be against it.;negative
Do you have evidence that there stance on guns would be no different if they were around in modern days?;negative
I guess about as much as you have that their stance would be different :) We do know that they were very much against losing rights, so it is likely that they would be against changing their stance.;negative
Your position is supported by zero evidence, and you cling to some kind of hope that they would believe something that they have said they do not believe in.;negative
I wish you luck in convincing the Founding Fathers to change their beliefs, you will need it.;positive
Remember you were the one who first claimed what the founding fathers would think as your argument, I don't necessarily believe one way or the other, but was arguing the other assertion to get you to realize your assertion was just an assertion.;negative
I succeeded.;positive
What rights do I want to take away?;neutral
I thought we have been over this...;neutral
I don't know what they'd think but I do know they had no idea what to expect from guns nowadays.;negative
I think you need to correct a few statements.;neutral
A) I was not the first person to claim something about Founding Fathers.;negative
B) You don't know anything.;negative
Maybe you should learn to read before even attempting to assert anything about what the Founding Fathers were thinking.;neutral
I am glad you have stopped your silly position of taking away rights and replacing it with the freedom to murder, this is a much better position for you to defend.;negative
Correction: I did not say you were the first to claim SOMETHING about the founding fathers, I said you were the first to claim what the founding fathers stance on gun politics nowadays would be.;negative
I don't know anything?;neutral
Good debating skills... I have no idea to argue against that point... Lol;negative
When did I ever want to take away anyone's rights?;neutral
Can you explain that to me?;neutral
When did I want to allow murder?;neutral
Can you explain that to me?;neutral
I'll be happy to clarify for you, what you can't understand through common sense.;positive
You haven't clarified a single thing.;negative
Why don't you clarify why you are such an idiot.;negative
All you have done is gone back on your own beliefs.;negative
You have the worst debating skills, you pick a side, change sides, then get mad because people remember you chose the first side.;negative
Then your go to move, tell the other guy, who is clearing beating you very badly, that he has bad debating skills.;negative
I hope you don't ever get accused of killing anyone because this whole murder freedom that you keep pushing might get you in trouble.;negative
By the way, my very first argument that the Founding Fathers would not know about the internet was in response to HoldTheMayo's stupid assertion that the second amendment should be modified.;negative
You then came in and pointed out that my statement was stupid, which PROVED my point.;negative
You lost this debate in your very first argument, congratulations on losing so bad.;negative
It is however hypocritical to brush off the fact that the Founding Fathers wouldn't know how life would have changed with respect to the 1st amendment and then argue that life has changed so the 2nd amendment is affected.;negative
I pointed out what was wrong with the idiotic line of thought that you share, and you proved me right, thank you.;positive
I asked you several times for clarification earlier and you provided nothing, and said stuff that was stupid like your stance on murder.;negative
Instead of trying to add to the discussion you tried to take away from it.;neutral
You said murder could be considered a freedom, which was by far the dumbest thing I have heard in a long time, and I keep bringing it up to show how stupid you are as a debater.;negative
You said you were against changing the 1st amendment, then you said you for changing the first amendment, then you said you were against changing the first amendment.;negative
Was that the 3 different arguments you were referring to?;neutral
So, please put down the crack pipe or the bong or whatever drugs you are on and just admit defeat.;negative
1st paragraph: yes but both of the stances on modifying either of them of requires a different multitude of arguments.;negative
2nd paragraph: like what?;neutral
Still accusing me of wanting to illegalize murder... sigh you are hopeless.;negative
I was trying to point out ANYTHING can be considered a freedom good grief... If you think it was so stupid then make a freaking point about it already instead of calling me an idiot for it over and over that is how a person with a below average IQ debates rather than annoying the hell out of someone ... If you just take 5 seconds to google it the defenition will say it is the power or right to act... You can be FREE to murder someone merely by having the power to do as such...;negative
1st amendment allowing harrassment online;neutral
If you push that limit far enough authorities WILL do something, if someone keeps attacking people on facebook you can block them, if someone threatens you online, you can call the police on them.;neutral
Any other defenition of cyber bullying I don't want to try to illegalize.;negative
Most cyber bullying that causes that are preventable.;neutral
The 1st amendment hasn't gone outdated... The 2nd amendment has a bit.;negative
Where have you been seeing recent bursts of group suicides equal to the massacres that blew up the news?;neutral
Gun regulation.;neutral
I am going to try a new technique, I will debate like you, so if I sound like an idiot it is your fault.;negative
What do you have to say about this:;neutral
No one has ever been hurt because someone owned a gun which is what the 2nd amendment specifies.;negative
People only get hurt by a gun when it is used, which is not protected under the 2nd amendment.;negative
Therefore, there is no reason to update the 2nd amendment.;negative
I said I'd be happy to clarify for you, not that I did...;positive
No we argued over 3 different things, of which all my stances on haven't changed.;neutral
I'm not mad but I find it funny how you like to try to turn everything back on me dishonestly.;negative
Again when did I want to allow murder?;neutral
What you said about the first amendment about the founding fathers was not what I was talking about.;negative
Just because holdthemayo thought that the 2nd amendment needed to be modified doesn't mean he thinks the same thing about the 2nd amendment.;negative
The point I was trying to make is just because someone thinks that perhaps the 2nd amendment needs to be modified doesn't necessarily mean It's hypocritical to not think the same thing about the 1st amendment.;negative
I think that the guns we have now and how they could possibly be utilized were not expected in the 1700's-1850's.;neutral
Nobody really thought of commiting mass crimes or shooting random citizens or any other possible examples when the 2nd amendment was passed.;negative
Typically guns back then were naturally going to be used for protection as they still are now, but in the 21st century we are finding an increase of gun abuse and horrible cases in which guns were used in an uncivilized fashion.;negative
I think they should be slightly tightened to begin avoidance of any future occurences, besides protection, that envoke violence or terror among the common people.;negative
Cars kill more people than guns.;negative
Should we ban them too?;negative
";)";neutral
Nah, we should though create bots to run our cars for us and give themselves maintenance checks so it should eliminate accidents, DUI's, deaths via automobile accidents and what not.;negative
However, I'm not so sure I would want skyNET/bots taking over the world.;neutral
And so quite frankly it comes down to a matter that perhaps people should do more training, older people whom can't see shouldn't drive, stuff like that.;negative
Changing the people would help this situation a ton.;neutral
Sure.;neutral
Or just have an AI do it.;neutral
I mean it would be nice to have my car drive itself.;negative
But cars have many limits on them.;neutral
we ban dangerous drivers and dangerous cars , everyone needs lessons galore and expensive licenses and expensive car tests and mechanics bills...they get tested regularly and vigorously, especially commercial vehicles.;negative
id also add vehicles add more to our quality of life , theyre not purposely built to destroy and kill...they also save lives galore such as ambulances, fire engines, taxis and regular cars can be used to escort people to hospital or women to maternity wards etc;negative
And that's why drunk drivers usually have multiple DWIs.;negative
"They are repeat offenders ;)";neutral
We also ban dangerous gun owners.;negative
Rational minded, responsible gun owners are not the ones going out and committing these atrocities.;negative
Family members in gun owning households are more likely than their non-gun-owning neighbors to die in a gun-related accidents, suicides, or homicides.;negative
What the hell do you need a gun for?;negative
Don't give me that crap about hunting... this is a civilized world, go get educated, go get a job, get some money, and go to Costco.;negative
Don't give me that crap about self-defence.;negative
How many cases of mugging would you encounter in a year?;negative
If its more than 2... go get educated, get a job, get some money, move to a better place.;negative
How often do we face home-invasions?;neutral
And how often would we actually have time to snap into response and draw our guns before we are held at gunpoint (if we don't deal with autoarms professionally as a soldier or cop).;negative
Get educated, and get rich, and get a bodyguard.;positive
Sure, relieving stress seems justified, but then, confine your gun to the gun range!;negative
You don't need it unless you work in an environment where you could get killed on a daily basis.;negative
Guns give us a false sense of bravado when in truth we could do just as well without it.;negative
The era for guns has long passed, just as the era for carrying swords and crossbows passed before it.;negative
Get with the program.;neutral
In shorrt, get an education and get out of debt.;negative
then u probs wont need guns.;negative
Cheers.;neutral
100% agree.....11500 americans are killed every year and 50000+ more and injured simply to allow everyone to buy as many weapons as they like for a hypothetical scenario that has a less than 1 in ten million chace of hapening and even if it did happen, the likelihood is that a gun wont save you anyways...the facts prove gun owners are 10 times more likely to be shot in their lives than non gun owners....though my major concern is assault wepaons;negative
No one needs automatic weapons to go hunting or to protect themselves same as the don't need big gun clips to go hunting or to protect themselves.;negative
"I want an automatic weapon with a big gun clip to pursue my happiness..., which is one of my unalienable rights ;)";negative
If it makes me happy to own those things, who are you to tell me I can't have them?;negative
"You are not the boss of me ;)";neutral
"I want to set homes on fire to pursue my happiness..., which is one of my unalienable rights ;)";neutral
If it makes me happy to set homes on fire, who are you to tell me I can't?;negative
"You are not the boss of me ;)";neutral
If they're you're homes and you don't burn anyone elses property in the process, burn all the homes you like.;negative
When you start burning other peoples stuff we have a problem.;neutral
Like you should be allowed to own a firearm but using it to shoot someone should be illegal... kinda like how it is now.;negative
Oh yeah, and I need access to a blow torch for my happiness to be complete.;positive
Anyway.;neutral
Nice strawman.;positive
Banning automatic guns isn't banning all guns nor tightening gun laws.;negative
You are addressing the Ban automatic guns?;neutral
tighten gun laws?;neutral
question in answer to my response to Joe, which was not the Ban automatic guns?;neutral
tighten gun laws?;neutral
subject.;neutral
It was pointing out a fallacy in his logic.;negative
If I said spaghetti was better than eggplant Parmesan would you answer that you should still be allowed to plug in your toaster and quit trampling on your toaster rights?;negative
To the gun question, here's that argument.;neutral
We don't let people have nuclear bombs.;negative
Sure, a responsible person could have a nuclear bomb and not hurt people, but why take that chance?;negative
We determine it is not worth the risk.;negative
It is perfectly acceptable to look at some guns and some gun laws and make rational decisions as to whether some are worth the risk.;neutral
I argue they are not.;neutral
Stats show conclusively smart regulation works.;positive
I think that is more important than whether someone wants to pretend they are defending against invisible black helicopters with their automatic gun arsenal.;negative
I also find it is those most vehement that they absolutely must have all of this firepower who are the least mentally stable and should not be allowed them.;negative
"I don't really see how my post was a strawman; I wasn't even addressing the subject, just your post.";negative
If I wanted to tie what I wrote to banning automatic weapons or tightening gun laws I would've done that.;neutral
But I didn't do that.;negative
"You might have been pointing out or trying to point out his faulty logic; I was pointing out that you were not comparing like with like.";negative
Joe was talking about simply owning an object.;neutral
You compared that to (presumably) maliciously and deliberately destroying the property of others.;neutral
It was just such an incredibly unfair comparison I felt the need to point it out.;negative
I think a better comparison would be cars or knives, perhaps.;negative
On the individual level do nuclear bombs have any purpose other than unquantifiable levels of destruction?;negative
You're either not using the nuke or you're using it to blow up several square miles and that's really all you can do with a nuke.;negative
Guns can be used and are regularly used for hunting, entertainment, and self-defense.;negative
That makes guns at least about as practically useful as cars or knives and hugely more practically useful (and less destructive) than a nuclear bomb.;negative
I think you're making another unfair comparison.;neutral
Like:;neutral
We don't let people have cars.;negative
Sure, a responsible person could have a car and not hurt people, but why take that chance?;negative
We determine it is not worth the risk.;negative
Except for we do let people have cars (it's a regulated process, like firearms) even though they kill loads of people ever year.;neutral
When you compare like with like you're point seems to have less impact.;neutral
Cool, that's about where I'm at with gun restrictions, too.;negative
I assume you're talking specifically about automatic guns, again?;negative
If you are I agree.;positive
Really the gist of my post was pointing out that owning a piece of property and going around destroying other peoples property are not the same thing at all.;negative
One is the simple act of owing a weapon, the other implies malicious intent to destroy, which is both not the same thing at all and very unfair because the connotation is all gun owners are malicious destroyers.;negative
And the most, because they know they can handle it.;negative
My roommate for example is a highly intelligent, self-made successful, reserved, modest, driven, educated (and for all intents and purposes mentally stable) city boy with a family history of military service and extensive experience and interest in firearms.;positive
He takes owning, handling, and using his guns (he has several) very seriously and he takes proper care always as the result of his proper training.;positive
A lot of my gun-owning family members are very similar to this.;positive
I know many people like this besides him.;neutral
Maybe it's just where I'm living but I know more stable, safe gun owners than not.;negative
In fact I can only think of two bad gun owners off tops.;negative
And it seems to me with all the gun owners in this country if people were really all that mentally unstable and paranoid there would be a lot more death than what we have now.;negative
But what we have now is the vast majority of gun owners chillin with their weapons, not shooting up invisible helicopters or - god forbid - schools.;negative
So again it seems incredibly unfair of you (unless you have some tangible statistics on the general mental stability and paranoia of gun owners - which very well might exist) to generalize people who own firearms as nutjobs defending against paranoid hallucinations because they're all so horribly mentally unstable.;negative
This was the argument I was answering.;negative
So from there, your reply to me created a strawman and was not addressing the same subject as me or what joe originally said.;negative
His premise was the pursuit of happiness and only the pursuit of happiness.;negative
My reply used the exact same logic.;negative
I feel I can jump into a debate two people are having and respond to any given point without also being obligated to address everything said before that point.;positive
That just sounds incredibly arderous, so I have no intent to start now.;negative
A strawman argument is a misrepresentation of someone elses argument that then presumably goes on to get attacked.;negative
"You're entire explanation of why my post was a straw man is essentially that it is off topic (""was not addressing the same subject as me or what joe originally said."")";negative
"; being off topic doesn't make an argument a strawman, it makes it off topic.";negative
As for it not being on topic, well, it addressed the point you made, referenced the point joe made, and then explained why joe's argument worked and why yours didn't.;negative
If that's not on topic I don't know what is.;negative
Yes, but his example didn't infringe on the happiness of others and yours did, which is why it was an unfair comparison and that's why I felt compelled to say something along those lines.;neutral
"He's talking about property he can own that would make him happy; you are talking about destroying the property of other people to make you happy.";positive
A.) those are not the same thing at all and a completely pointless comparison and b.) using the premise of the pursuit of happiness your example also fails because it relies on impacting the happiness of others for your own happiness while joes example only impacts joes happiness.;negative
So yes, you used the same logic, but that logic your argument holds no water and his does.;negative
I know, right?;neutral
Funny how that works.;positive
"One up vote for you ;)";neutral
"Your right to pursue happiness ends where my rights begin ;)";negative
Me owning assault weapons does not impact you in any way shape or form.;negative
I don't know that.;negative
You might be a psycho and you might shoot me.;negative
Obviously all of the recent shootings, their right to own a gun didn't affect anyone, until it did.;positive
My question would be, if your happiness is dependent on having all of that fire power, are you mentally stable enough to own all of that fire power?;negative
The longer this gun debate drags on the more I'm finding that gun nuts really are nuts.;negative
"It could almost be a litmus test: ""Do you believe that your happiness depends on having an assault rifle and/or that any regulation at all is a plot by the government to punish you for some reason?""";negative
"If they answer anything but ""that's fucking stupid"" they shouldn't be allowed to have a gun.";negative
So..., you're saying that I should give up my rights in the event that I may one day, perhaps, maybe, violate yours?;negative
"And you consider that rational ;)";negative
No more or less rational than laws against stocking biological weapons, creating nuclear bombs, building meth labs, etc.;negative
No more or less rationale than wanting to do any of that.;negative
We draw lines all of the time.;positive
Why stop the right to arm oneself at semi-automatics?;negative
Why not let people build nuclear bombs joe?;negative
It's the same thing.;neutral
Some people just have a hard-on for these particular weapons for some reason.;negative
There is nothing any law abiding citizen could ever need a gun that fires that many bullets that fast.;negative
At the same time we see almost every month it seems now, that you gun nuts are incapable of keeping your guns out of the hands of even nuttier individuals.;negative
So too bad.;negative
You're all in time out.;neutral
No guns for you until you learn how to play responsibly.;neutral
If your out setting homes on fire, then you are intentionally harming others, and your point is invalid.;negative
You obviously do not have the mental acuity to handle fire, therefore should we make all fires illegal?;negative
Okay.;neutral
I want to build a nuclear bomb in my basement.;negative
For protection.;neutral
And say I'm a nuclear scientist.;neutral
It's the same argument.;neutral
As this debate clearly shows, anti gun regulation is based on imagination.;negative
Well I imagine I need a nuclear bomb to defend myself.;negative
Never mind that as with guns, you are more likely to hurt yourself of a loved on on accident, you are in fact more likely to have it stolen and used by a psycho in some kind of crime, then ever using it to defend yourself.;negative
I imagine I'm Rambo and it makes me feel like a tough guy or whatever.;negative
Better gun control including limiting fire power and doing real background checks means less innocent people, and innocent kids, being shot.;positive
That's a fact.;neutral
But you don't care.;negative
You are in imagination land and think you're Rambo.;neutral
The 2nd amendment wasn't designed to protect the rights of hunters, it was enacted so that people could protect themselves from a tyrannical government.;negative
It was created to ensure that the people would be able to maintain the freedoms represented by the constitution.;positive
Simply put, the rights of the constitution are those deemed inalienable, and the second amendment is there to insure they remain such.;negative
How can a people defend themselves from the government, unless they are able to maintain the same weapons as the government has?;negative
How is a gun more useful.than knives?;neutral
I've never seen people cut up vegetables properly with a machine gun.;negative
The difference is knives are a tool, a domestic neccesity, along with tools such as screwdrivers and domestic appliances such as toasters all of which can kill under accidental circumstances, however their benefit outweights the possible issues.;negative
A firearm is not useful like this, the only use for a firearm outside hunting or recreation is security, which a simple handgun would do.;negative
You don't need 100 automatic weapons to fend off a likely unarmed intruder, often a bat or long armed weapon would be a much more appropriate weapon.;negative
You don't stop a fire by throwing fuel onto it.;negative
If its for recreation then keep it at the range and if its hunting a simple bolt action rifle is sufficient, you don't need military grade weapons.;negative
100% correct, very accurate assessment, great post, keep it up!;positive
Handguns are used in 89% of gun related murders in this country.;negative
Assault rifles - 3%.;negative
Handguns are much easier to kill with, and assault rifles serve the purpose, a well-regulated militia, which is outlined in the constitution.;negative
You're after the wrong weapons.;negative
Handguns should be limited as well, just as they are here, and we no longer need a militia as we have an army and a reserve force which is the modern equivalent.;negative
That law was for a fledgling nation still trying to sort itself out.;negative
Yes, we have an illegal standing army, and this is your reason for not needing assault weapons - weapons which cause a miniscule portion of the death in our society.;negative
The law was created to stop tyranny - The founding fathers feared 2 things more than anything else - large financial institutions and standing armies.;negative
We have one controlling our government and the other defending it, and your solution is to remove the possibility of a state controlled, citizen militia.;negative
Genius.;neutral
Read Federalist #45 when you have a moment.;negative
Madison makes fun of you in it, and I'd hate for you to miss that.;positive
There is no state militia, and against the US army, airforce and navy you have zero chance of winning, plus simple militias are not acceptable for defending the juicy pig that is the US.;negative
Every time the US got into hot water it had to recruit a standing army and basically go through the process of rearmament which would not work in todays society where wars can be over quickly or cause huge loss of life easily.;negative
Also to humor the prospect of the NEED for assault rifles simply because of tryanny lets put it this way, they say assault rifles make up only 2-3% of homocides, now between 1960 and 2011 there were approximately 908,000 homicides, which means that about 18,100 people were killed by those assault rifles, almost 1 per day.;negative
So each day a person must die for the paranoia of tyranny.;negative
To me there is nothing more tyrranous than that.;negative
The Korean nationals who used assault weapons to defend themselves and their places of business during the L.A. Riots would disagree with you.;negative
Many of the looters had small arms, and the only reason that the livelihoods of the Koreans were not destroyed, their businesses turned into burning ruins, like so many others during this time, was because they had the means to defend themselves and their property.;negative
And once again why did the looters have small arms?;negative
- because there are many in circulation.;neutral
Plus those riots were between citizens, it wasnt the government trying to attack, it was citizens on other citizens.;negative
Given any opportunity people will group with their people and not help anyone else, as seen in those riots where the attacks on the koreans were mainly by african americans.;negative
Next, alot of the weapons the koreans used were improvised, shotguns or small arms, only a few had heavier weaponry.;negative
Thirdly that riot was not quelled by civilians valiantly using their weapons weapons in vigilante justice, but rather by the National Guard and the Marines.;negative
Fourthly if the koreans were so amazing at defending themselves then why did they account for almost half of the property damage?;negative
Finally, when you line this up with other countries that have significant laws you see a huge difference, in the L.A riots over 2000 were injured and 56 killed, in for example the Australian race riots there were less than 50 injuries;neutral
Automatic guns have no purpose in a civilised society.;negative
They were made for war and killing.;neutral
People outside of war should'nt have access to guns that can shoot 30 bullets in a few seconds and kill so many people.;negative
The ammendment was written when a gun was a musket that took 5 minutes to reload and was created in case England tried to invade.;neutral
USA is one of the most powerful countries in modern age so i doubt that will happen soon.;positive
Automatic guns asre wrong in this kind of society.;negative
Sure not everyone will kill someone, but one person who decides they wll can kill 30 school children in seconds.;negative
Is it worth the risk?;neutral
No.;neutral
Strict gun laws are needed because the atrocious gun violence in America is horrible.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
Guns should be banned.;neutral
Guns are meant to protect not kill but in the last few days we are seeing people killing each other;neutral
Actually, the United States is not as bad as you think.;negative
The World Health Organization did a recent study on gun murder per 100,000 people.;negative
The US is at 4.3.;neutral
Though this is higher than other countries, there are many civilized countries with higher ones.;negative
"Russia, 10.2; N. Korea 15.2 (they have the most restrictive laws period); Greenland, 19.2; Puerto Rico, 26.2; Jamaica, 52.2; and Honduras with the highest at 91.6.";negative
All of these countries are considered civilized and not 3rd World, and every single one of them (other than the US) have banned weapons.;negative
Coincidence?;neutral
I think not.;neutral
Also, Automatics and Assault Weapons are already banned.;negative
The reason many are giving for banning these weapons is because of stupid exterior options, like grips and larger mags.;negative
Like a hand grip under the forearm is going to make it more deadly.;negative
And banning larger clips won't help anything.;negative
The criminal will be obliged to bring more mags.;negative
The only reason people are attacking it is because they have been for many years and have used this tragedy to their advantage.;negative
They want to give the government even more power, which it has too much already.;negative
There is no evidence to support banning extended mags and grips.;negative
"The only reason they are being banned is because of them being ""scary looking"".";negative
in fairness the last 4 or 5 mass killings of children and adults have been carried out with thesde military style assault weapons that fire multiple bullets (up to 100 per minute);negative
Which ones, Sandy Hook is the only one which comes to mind.;negative
Actually, the guy in Sandy Hook used 4 pistols.;negative
An AR-15 was in his car, but never used, and even that has some controversy on whether it actually was an AR-15.;negative
And the mass media has made a point of pushing that, even going as far as linking these weapons to events were they weren't used.;negative
So now we have crazies out there, who, thanks to exploitation by the media, intend on committing these types of acts.;negative
And since they saw that these weapons are being used successfully by others that have similar motives, as sensationalized by the media, What kind of weapon do you think their going to try to get their hands on to use?;negative
Which ones?;neutral
The only one I know of that used one was Aurora Colorado.;negative
Nothing in the constitution discusses what types of arms citizens are permitted to own.;negative
Would the NRA argue that private citizens can ride to work in tanks, carry grenade launchers and flame throwers, or patrol their neighborhoods with weaponized drones?;negative
Take this to its illogical extreme- does the second amendment guarantee our citizens the right to own nuclear devices?;negative
We have to draw the line somewhere to prevent civilian ownership of military weapons - restricting assault rifles is just common sense;negative
"""The sword and rifle and the bayonet and canon and all terrible implements of the solder are the birth right of the American citizen""- Benjamin Franklin";negative
You can own a tank and drive it (they are pretty cool).;negative
You can own flamethrowers and grenade launchers, but when have they been used in a mass murder or crime?;negative
Weaponized drones are too expensive, and not a lot of people want one.;negative
Nuclear devices are pretty illegal already for civilians.;negative
We have drawn the line.;neutral
People just want to keep pushing that line until we have absolutely no guns, which will never happen.;negative
Assault rifles are already heavily controlled and have not been used in crimes in the last few decades.;negative
Russia's crime rate has been dropping over the years, down from over 30 in 1995.;negative
Greenland is not a member state of the UN and doesn't follow all thier laws, North Koreas has also been dropping in time.;negative
Honduras allowed concealed weapons etc until 2007.;negative
"Of the 800,000 weapons estimated there, over 650,000 are unregistered, with 500,000 being ""military grade"".";negative
Gun laws don't fix problems overnight, it takes decades for it to get to a good level.;negative
It is a long term fix to a long term addiction.;negative
Way to cherry pick.;neutral
Here's a more complete look.;neutral
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/files/2012/12/firearm-OECD-UN-data3.jpg;neutral
Minus factors like drug cartels running countries or countries in a state of chaos due to extreme poverty and roving war bands, there is a very direct correlation in between gun control and deaths.;negative
The U.S. is a prime example of where our cowboy mentality and rejection of fact leads to way way way more dead people than we should ever accept.;negative
Cherry Pick.;neutral
Look at your article.;neutral
Notice it did not mention anyone above the United States, which there are many more countries that are.;negative
This is a classic example of bias.;positive
It is indisputable that your facts are correct.;neutral
However, it takes it out of context from the rest of the world.;neutral
There are like 10 countries ahead of the U.S., you've mentioned like three of them.;negative
The other 70 something countries with statistics all do a better job, many 2nd world countries do a better job.;negative
It is an odd habit of those on your side of issues, to wrap yourselves in American flags made of strawmen and re-written history, to contentedly brag about this country in areas where we are in the bottom 10% in terms of performance while accusing anyone who dares suggest the U.S. should be in the top 1% (us being the richest and most advanced country in the history of the world after all) in any area, whether it be gun violence or healthcare, of somehow being against what this country stands for.;negative
Well, you have that right.;positive
For me, I'd rather be one of the best countries in terms of gun violence.;positive
Since statistically we know for an absolute fact that better regulation of high powered guns and better background checks works, that is what I am for.;negative
Tell yourself all the fairy tales about mexican stand-offs in your home you like, and continue to only compare the U.S. to societies decades behind us to backup your fantasies if you like.;negative
Try to remember in some part of your mind though, that this specific pursuit of fantasy has lead to more innocent deaths than nearly any other country in the world.;neutral

It shows a map of gun ownership versus gun violence in the entire world.;neutral

Every time anyone studies this subject who isn't a right wing nut group like Breitbart or the NRA itself, the numbers are the same.;negative
The U.S. has a huge problem and better gun control is a proven way to solve it.;negative
I'm not looking at the site itself.;negative
If you noticed on the bottom of the maps, they were a from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.;negative
This site was the only one that had it in a convienent package.;negative
And almost all of these site are left wing nut sites.;negative
And your fact check site showed that gun ownership and manufacture have increased, yet the gun crimes are in their lowest.;negative
><;neutral
When you start calling Wikipedia (who's using WHO stats) Forbes, and Business Insider left wing sources you know your have fallen off the deep end.;negative
Left wing sources would be Huffington Post or MSNBC, who consequently use the same set of facts.;negative
The left has an annoying habit of not pulling bullshit completely out of their ass, unlike Breitbart and others.;negative
What would that do?;neutral
Criminals don't follow the law why is that so hard to understand?;negative
All guns are banned in Mexico and the cartels have all the Gus they want.;negative
It's called the black market genius.;negative
The problem with laws is that only law abiding citizens follow them.;negative
Criminals already by and sell illegal drugs and guns in this country we should make as many guns available to people who can pass a background check as is possible.;neutral
The criminals will have any gun they want anyway.;neutral
so should the honest law abiding citizens they pray on.;positive
100% wrong.;negative
get more guns out of criculation and theres far less chance of idiots and criminals getting hold of one.;negative
tighten gun laws and empower the police to enforec these laws.;negative
this is how it has worked brilliantly in all of europe since they tightended gun laws.;positive
they dont sell them in shops, nor bullets and only people with legitimate reasons can buy guns.;negative
assault weapons are 100% illegal.;negative
no citizen needs a gun firing 100 bullets a minute.;negative
as weve seen for years they soon fall into the hands of maniacs and NOONE can defend themselves agaisnt such a weapon, not even ex soldiers not even navy seals.;negative
the end result is the gun murder rate in europe is 80 times lower than america.;negative
so for example france or uk has 35 gun murders a year , thats 1 in every 2.48 million people, in america 11500 were gunned down last year, thats 1 in every 30,000 people...80 times the murder rate;negative
"""Those who sacrifice liberty in the name of safety deserve and receive neither""- Benjamin Franklin";neutral
I'd rather be alive without the right to have ludicrous firepower than risk death so I can have some toys.;negative
Feeling the need to always carry bigger guns with more bullets because you are in constant fear of someone else with bigger guns and more bullets is not freedom, and it is that sort of fear which allows one to give up the true liberties which Franklin was speaking of.;positive
Freedom is the ability to go about your day without a gun because you know that laws made by the people are enforced by people appointed by people.;neutral
If your idea of fun is having a sensible gun, fine, no one is suggesting all guns be banned, only common sense rules concerning them, similar to common sense rules about driving a car.;negative
btw, I didn't know if you realized but your avatar is all wrong.;negative
You are throwing around your American-ness whilst waiving around the flag of a group of slave-driving anti-american separatists.;negative
You might want to change that up.;neutral
Actually the confederate constitution outlawed the slave triad check your history.;negative
My avatar expresses my southern and bronyness pride that's all.;neutral
And freedom is being able to own any gun you feel is adequate for you defense.;positive
Ugh.;neutral
It's so sad how schools in the south are allowed to misinform you poor bastards.;negative
The South never outlawed slavery and never intended to.;negative
Toward the end of the war when it was obvious they were going to get their slave driving asses kicked they began abandoning laws that supported slavery in small part, but that was after they were losing, and it was only partially.;negative
They never made a law saying slavery of any type was illegal.;neutral
And your definition of freedom is almost as sad as your knowledge of history.;negative
If you are so scared for yourself that you are against all gun control no matter how many kids and innocent people gun control could save, you are a pussy.;negative
wow type A yankee ignorence the confederate constitution out lawed the slave traid but not ownership that was expected to go away on its own in time.;positive
and my deffiniton of freedom is the very same as our nation's founders thank you very much.;positive
their is a reason why they said our rights to keep and bare arms must not be infringed so stop infringing them.;negative
1.;neutral
You are still incorrect.;neutral
The timing of limits to slave trade were precisely when it became evident the their loss was inevitable.;neutral
It was part of their strategy to re-shift their reasoning away from slavery (which was the true purpose of their rebellion) which they found had become somewhat less popular in the South, being as only around 30% of households still owned slaves at that point--as fucking barbaric and backwards as even that was.;negative
2.;neutral
The right to bear arms never included nor was intended to include unregulated arms or even unlimited arms.;negative
Regulation was and always was a key element of the amendment.;neutral
3.;neutral
"And most importantly their reasoning was a ""trained militia"" because at that time the U.S. ability to quickly put together a militia was limited.";negative
It's purpose was not to encourage a paranoid psychosis about rogue governments or hordes of bandits at the doorstep.;negative
That you actually believe that but for a bunch of hillbillies ability to buy military style weapons the U.S. would fall to some invisible tyranny, would be comical if it were not so prevalent.;negative
Seriously, I don't know when so much of the country went nuts but it's this type of reasoning that makes rational people start to think gun control proposed doesn't go far enough.;negative
I'm beginning to think that a litmus test for any gun ownership should be how much one foams and rants when logical people suggest only limiting them.;negative
If you are that into guns, I'm uncomfortable with you having any type of gun at all honestly.;negative
It's just a matter of time before a cat at your window scares your delicate ass and you shoot your kids or something--which is more common than fending off bandits at the door by the way.;positive
You are warped dude.;negative
Let me tell you something A your very bad at history.;negative
And B the term shall not be infringed means shall not be fucking infringed so hands off gun grabber.;negative
And I am very responsible with my fire arms no one in my house is in any danger.;negative
And it's undeniable the government is gaining new power because of there clever use of this AlQuida boogy man (which they funded and trained back it the 80s) wake up little lamb this was their plan all along do you get it now?;positive
You can just tell me.;neutral
You don't have to tell me you're going to tell me... or ask permission if that is what you are trying to do.;negative
I gave you the link did I not?;negative
You've not supplied anything to the contrary.;negative
You cannot in fact because this is correct, there were some laws limiting some slave trade in the South late in the war, after they realized they were going to lose.;negative
That's a fact.;neutral
Now you can pretend the timing is coincidence, and you can pretend it was about state's rights, but you are living in a fantasy.;positive
Those with power in the South were the ones with slaves, the only right they were afraid for was their right to own other humans.;negative
That's it.;neutral
There was no other issue bothering them, least not to the extent of going to war over it.;negative
Did that sound clever in your head?;neutral
"Anyway, its the right of a ""regulated"" ""state"" ""militia"" if you are not in a state militia and are not regulated the amendment does not apply to you.";negative
The Supreme Court later ruled individuals do have a right to firearms, but they upheld that regulation was still perfectly legal.;negative
So quit arguing strawmen, the issue is regulation not taking all guns away, and regulation is legal by every definition of the amendment and more importantly smart, because smart regulation means less dead innocent people.;negative
That's what they all say.;neutral
Sure, the Patriot Act, which I'm 90% against.;negative
Nothing to do with guns though, it's a separate issue entirely and I have no idea why you are bringing it up.;negative
I know.;neutral
Regan funded Al Qaeda, then Bush started a war in Iraq saying it was Al Qaeda (and nukes), then Obama killed the leader of Al Qaeda who was like a thousand miles away from Iraq.;negative
My question is why you southern hillbillies hate Obama so much, he kicks ass when it comes to getting terrorists, something like 5x as many in 4 years than Bush in 8.;negative
Again though, this has nothing to do with guns.;negative
Do I get that you are making vague connections in between foreign policy and your right to bear arms?;neutral
I think so.;neutral
Do I get why you are making that slightly schizophrenic connection?;neutral
I must admit I do not.;neutral
First of al there was no link but to the topic at hand.;negative
The Last part of my argument had admitibly nothing to do with gun control I was showing you how our government creates these terrorist boogie men they uses them to scare us so bad we will gladly give any right away just to feel safe Ben Franklin is spinning in his grave right now.;negative
And I hate Obama because he's a socialist who is playing ball with that un american bitch polosie.;negative
The Supreme Court ruled that the people are the militia therefore it dose apply to me and following a strict interpretation of the constitution there is no way anyone can say restrictions are legal.;negative
More restrictions result in more confident criminals ONLY.;negative
I don't think we need a ban on automatic weapons.;neutral
Banning guns will just esclate the problem.;negative
Just leave it as it is and maybe have guards in schools at risk.;negative
But do you need an automatic weapon in order to defend yourself or to go hunting?;neutral
Automatic weapons are already illegal.;negative
Military style weapons have been used for hunting and defense.;negative
I believe there was a man who stood atop his house while racial riots were going down in LA.;negative
He defended his family and home from the mob with an AR-15.;positive
yes but a gun would have done the same, also the fact is because there are 300 million guns in america now, its too easy for maniacs and criminals to get hold of them, its a downward spirral of guns and violence.;negative
the trick is to get as many off our streets , tighten gun controls, ban automatics and military style guns and pay more tax so the government can seriously find and treat the tens of millions of untreated mentally ill people in this country.;negative
the issue is to go after guns and mental health.;neutral
those who have legitimate gun licenses can of course carry on as normal.;neutral
but not with the military style guns.;negative
they must also keep their guns locked away safer unlike the mother of the latest mass murderer;neutral
Banning automatics has already been done unless you have a license (I feel like a parrot).;negative
The military weapons are used in a fraction of a percent of gun crimes.;negative
Mental health needs to be looked at.;negative
Banning these guns did not work previously, so why are we doing the exact same experiment expecting different results?;negative
We don't need to tighten gun controls.;negative
We need to enforce the ones we have.;negative
Not much is being done in that area.;negative
Paying more taxes to the government isn't a good idea.;negative
They need to fix the debt first and stop wasting the taxes they get already.;negative
Reforms on taxes is a good idea.;positive
Getting guns off the street is a good idea.;positive
Studies by the FBI show that most of them are in areas of high poverty.;negative
Lets help those out and crime will be reduced, especially in Chicago and other big cities.;neutral
We can not carry military style guns, that is already into law.;negative
Only pistols.;neutral
Keeping guns locked away won't be solved by a law, but by training and ad campaigns.;negative
The second amendment dose not apply to hunting so that's an invalid argument.;negative
And when it comes to self defense it depends on what your attacker has many criminals have automatic weapons both illegal models (full automatic) and legal models (semi automatic) and will even if they are banned.;negative
no, but its fun to have one.;positive
my dad collects weapons as a hobby, he has old muskets to a thompson.;negative
My point of view is bias but i don't see the need to get rid of automatic guns.;negative
For hunting, no.;negative
For defense absolutely.;neutral
If crooks and the government (pretty much one in the same anymore) have them, then you better believe that I want the same to defend myself.;negative
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that automatic guns are already banned.;negative
So, we're cool on that one.;positive
Handguns are used in 89% of the murders in this country.;negative
Assault rifles are used in less than 3%.;negative
If you had to choose only one type of gun to ban, and the goal was to stop gun violence, assault rifles are a poor choice.;negative
of course not...we have too many evil people roaming the earth...those gun laws dont mean jack to them...and lets not forget about the tyrants that fake terrorist attacks and school shootings in order to further their hidden agendas;negative
Disarmed People = Are Dominated People;neutral
Simple as that so do we really want to ban guns?;negative
Gun crime has gone down in the US.;negative
The media pumps it up.;neutral
You should not ban automatic guns and tighten gun laws unless you are going to subject your armies and police force to the same ends.;negative
It's bad enough they power trip over everyone lets not add the fact that they will be incredibly over powered if there ever needs to be a revolt in your country due to tyrannical governments.;negative
Keep your guns for fuck sakes.;neutral
People are so concerned with safety that your willing to give up something that keeps you safe.;positive
Where's the logic in that!;neutral
No, you need a licence to get a automatic gun today.;neutral
The only problem is some moron stealing it.;negative
Then your screwed.;neutral
Thats why OTHER people have guns.;negative
how does it hurt anyone what I own;neutral
how is the 2nd amendment outdated?;negative
why don't we just punish the criminals?;negative
That's the real problem.;negative
As far as tanks and military aircraft..., how long have we been fighting radicals in both Iraq and Afghanistan?;negative
And all they have are guns.;neutral
the answer was no.;negative
don't write blah blah blah, I won't even come close to addressing your question blah blah blah.;negative
you demonstrate a clear lack of knowledge required to change a fundamental right;negative
These are such good points against me man, accussing me of being irresponsible without logic as to why applaudes congratulations, I guess you got me checkmated good sir.;positive
What right do I want to take away?;neutral
How do you figure that?;neutral
completely disregarding my argument and with absolutely no effort of refuting;negative
The 3 different arguments;neutral
1st amendment;neutral
It is perfectly acceptable to look at some guns and some gun laws and make rational decisions as to whether some are worth the risk.;neutral
I argue they are not.;neutral
Stats show conclusively smart regulation works.;positive
I also find it is those most vehement that they absolutely must have all of this firepower who are the least mentally stable and should not be allowed them.;negative
"I want an automatic weapon with a big gun clip to pursue my happiness..., which is one of my unalienable rights ;)";negative
If it makes me happy to own those things, who are you to tell me I can't have them?;negative
"You are not the boss of me ;)";neutral
His premise was the pursuit of happiness and only the pursuit of happiness.;negative
My reply used the exact same logic.;negative
Me owning assault weapons does not impact you in any way shape or form.;negative
Let me tell you something;neutral
A your very bad at history;negative
the term shall not be infringed means shall not be fucking infringed so hands off gun grabber;neutral
And I am very responsible with my fire arms no one in my house is in any danger;negative
And it's undeniable the government is gaining new power because of there clever use of this AlQuida boogy man;positive
(which they funded and trained back it the 80s);neutral
wake up little lamb this was their plan all along do you get it now?;negative
"In all debates concering the implementation of Gun Laws in America, I have been getting people who have said that ""I'd rather be killed instantly with a bullet than a fist, this is why we shouldn't have gun laws!""";negative
"or ""If America bans citizens the easy access to guns, more people will die!""";negative
... I'm not sure about them, but I believe that lessening the accessibility of guns would actually reduce the amount of deaths in America, if not the death by firearm rate.;negative
Don't they want less people to die over there, or do they just want to keep huggin their guns?;negative
"Just think about this: not everyone is ""normal,"" and so their brains may work in a different way from the rest of us.";neutral
By this I mean that there are mentally ill people out there who would kill you for looking at them wrong or something.;negative
If you were to piss one of these mentally ill people off, all they would have to do is go to the local Gun store, buy a gun, and pelt the shit out of you with bullets.;negative
Now if in this scenario, there was no Gun shop for that psycho to purchase guns, he would have to spend years making friends with some of the underground gangs so he could have a connection with the black market.;negative
Then he would have to work for months to purchase a suitable gun from the black market, and track you down to kill you.;neutral
But over that period of time, he would of just gotten over it, as any human would.;negative
But, if the psycho couldn't be bothered going through all this work to kill you, he would just lunge at you with his fists.;negative
Apparently, some people say that this fate is worse than getting cut to pieces by burning-hot, poisonous lead.;negative
What they don't realize is that... you can defend yourself in a melee fight or even run away.;negative
In a gun fight, you wouldn't stand a chance.;negative
- Not to mention how anyone can intervene in a fight involving melee, perhaps like a security guard, to break them apart, and that you are more likely walk out of hospital alive after a melee attack, instead of a gun attack.;negative
Also, most of the crimes in America involving Guns (such as the school shootings) were made possible by criminals getting their hands on purchased guns.;negative
Is it so wrong to think that lessening the accessibility of guns will in the least lessen the amount of people getting shot by guns?;negative
'Murica;neutral
Is there something I'm missing here?;negative
Gun violence is out of hand in America.;negative
Strict gun laws are needed.;neutral
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
Your argument is retarted and completely biased.;negative
If the psycho wanted to kill you and no gun was available he could grab any sharp or blunt object, a rope to strangle you, he might be able to kill you with his bare hands and if you're a liberal he could even kill you with the truth.;negative
You wouldn't stand a chance in a gunfight because you don't have a gun to defend yourself.;negative
I see you haven't read my argument properly.;negative
You maybe just scanned it in a fit of rage or something.;negative
"I mentioned in my argument that fighting with melee weapons is avoidable, since you have more of a chance to get away or have someone intervene to break up a fight, (eg; security guard.)";negative
"Tell me this straight; do you think you have a better chance of surviving/avoiding a gun fight, or a melee fight?";negative
But the gun fight wouldn't of started if the person who started it didn't have access to guns.;negative
And usually the authorities will neutralize the threat.;neutral
I beg to differ.;negative
:P;neutral
I hope you realize that gun control INCREASES crime, because the criminals will still get guns and the law abiding citizens will not be able to defend themselves as easily.;neutral
Gun control DOES NOT WORK, this is easy to prove, just look at history, it does not reduce crime.;negative
Now if everyone had guns, thered be way less crime because why pull a gun on someone when 5 others will pull one on you to defend the citizen?;negative
"edit ""and usually the authorities will neutralize the threat"" YA after they get doughnuts and wait 5 minutes to show up, that made me LOL thank you, and no, he wouldnt have to wait years to get through the black markert, if you have the cash they will give you it, no questions asked";negative
So random people all over the street, including mentally ill individuals all having access to guns is what lowers crime?;negative
I fail to see the logic in that.;negative
Please provide proof.;neutral
Say that to all the children who were shot in school shootings because the dumbass person who shot them had access to guns from a gun shop.;neutral
Also, all countries with less death rates by firearm are actually ones that come up as the most safest places in the world.;negative
"Take my city for example; No guns, yet number one as the most livable city on Earth.";negative
Using stereotypes can be fallacious.;negative
And we would have less criminals with guns in the first place if we removed their availability, so the Authorities would not take as long to neutralize a threat, if there ever were to be one.;negative
Tell me where can you find a black market?;negative
How will you get enough money to buy their 10,000 dollar weapons which are usually meant for people with insane amounts of money?;neutral
Not so easy isn't it.;negative
Btw why is it so hard to believe that not every criminal has instant access to the black market?;negative
Almost all shootings involved guns purchased at gun stores, because why would petty criminals want to go through the hard work of buying one through the black market when there are gun stores right in front of them.;negative
If we removed those stores, would it not be logical to think that criminals would have less access to guns, and therefore would have less gun-fights?;negative
(Geez some people get so snappy when it comes their guns.;negative
:P);neutral
Well or you can just disarm the entire nation so they cant fight back in times of tyranny............;negative
you live in australia, theres like... one city there and the rest is barren desert, and your on an island, very tight knit community i am guessing.;negative
In a time with less availability to guns, the black market would have a much larger presence, and would be way easier to access, and besides i dont have guns i just know what happens when you disarm a nation, and its not good;negative
Times of tyranny caused upon the access of guns.;positive
And the retrieval of all guns could be lucrative for recycling precious metals to make, say, more wells in impoverished parts of Africa?;negative
And fighting back with guns only ends up with another dead human being at the end of the day.;negative
What the hell?;neutral
There are like 2500+ towns and cities in Australia.;negative
Australia's not just full of barren desert you culturally illiterate dumbass.;negative
:P;neutral
"Yes... relying your ""facts"" on what you want to be true.";negative
When you disarm a nation, you disarm a large percent of their criminals and soon-to-be criminals- and that still counts to reduce crime, and will therefore make police officers less busy, and more quick to neutralize armed criminals if there are any.;negative
Perhaps what we need is more honest law enforcers, and more far-ranged tazers instead of selling lead-bullet guns.;negative
Any gun control is unconstitutional.;negative
So no, guns should not be banned nor should any type of ban be in place.;negative
2nd amendment: A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE to keep and bear arms shall NOT be INFRINGED.;negative
any law to limit type of gun used, owned, or banned guns, ammo, magazine size, etc. is by definition INFRINGEMENT of the 2nd amendment because the government is telling its people whats ok and not ok.;negative
where in any of that ideology of gun control laws does that spell freedom?;neutral
once the infringement begins with the 2nd amendment where will it stop?;negative
government says movies and video games are to violent and ban them.;negative
big macs, soda, and fries make you to fat so we'll ban those.;negative
Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free citizens.;negative
Criminals do not follow laws.;negative
That is BY DEFINITION a criminal!!!;negative
They will steal guns, get them from the black market, or from any illegal shipments from other countries if they have to.;neutral
"Most of these mass shootings happen in so called ""gun free zones"".";neutral
where gun control laws prohibit good law abiding citizens from carrying a gun to protect themselves and others.;neutral
These gun free zones like schools, hospitals, post offices, most government areas, as well as buisnesses and public conventions that post no gun allowed signs, are basically advertising to these criminals, psychos, and mass murders that this will be a easy place to slaughter people because no one can defend themselves!!!;negative
how often do you hear of a mass shooting or gun related firefight at a place where there are known 100's of gun carriers like gun shows, police stations, or nra conventions?;negative
Because criminals know some people will be packing a gun there and it will not be easy.;negative
there are thousands of stories where armed citizens stop criminals, in many cases without firing a shot and just showing the gun.;negative
The liberal media today mostly just films the major gun massacres and shootings because its big news, gets peoples attention, ratings, and promotes their agenda for gun control.;negative
If the psycho wanted to kill you and no gun was available he could grab any sharp or blunt object, a rope to strangle you, he might be able to kill you with his bare hands and if you're a liberal he could even kill you with the truth.;negative
You wouldn't stand a chance in a gunfight because you don't have a gun to defend yourself.;negative

If you wanna hunt.;neutral
practice shooting, or keep a gun for self defense wouldnt these be for the better?;negative
so many people break laws anyway and no guns will make people mad and express it by breaking that law and using guns in a VIOLENT way!;negative
"thats great but the second amendments primary purpose is not about ""hunting, practice shooting or self defense"" it is to protect its citizens from the government.";neutral
well, if you take away gun rights, all that means is law abiding citizens won't be able to get guns.;negative
so, when all the law breakers get their underground weapons (as they do now actually), they can have the upper hand since law abiding citizens won't have anything to defend themselves with.;negative
basically, if you take away gun rights, you let the bad people have control;negative
If they take away the right to own guns, what am I going to shoot after a few beers?;negative
Owning a gun should not be a privilege in the first place, it's a right granted under the US constitution and any law or view that makes it a privilege in the first place is Unconstitutional.;negative
This question is as absurd as should freedom of speech, press and religion be taken away.;negative
If you want to take away the right to bear arms then change the constitution, otherwise these laws that weasel around it and make it a privilege should not be tolerated.;negative
If we don't have are right to guns then the goverment will start to be opressive.;positive
Yesterday, a proposed amednment that would've created more extensive background check for those who purchase weapons, something that many polls have shown anywhere from 75-90 percent of America supports, failed in the Senate, with almost every single Republican Senator voting it down.;negative
What's your view on this?;neutral
I think it is a good idea afterall if you want a loan to buy a house or to adopt a baby they have them so why not for firearms, if your denied you should be told why and have the right to appeal the decision.;negative
Maybe if the anti legislation people met the pro's halfway, came up with their own ideas instead of blathering on about their rights to own as many guns and as much ammo as possible to defend themselves against the government (which frankly makes them sound Paranoid) the pro legislation people might listen instead of coming up with draconian ideas.;negative
Afterall who knows more about sensible gun ownership than sensible gun owners, that way you'd get legislation that suits.;negative
Sensible gun laws should suit both sides, I know that it would not prevent shootings or criminals having guns but it might prevent more people shooting up schools with guns they own or have access to legally.;negative
If your a law abiding citizen who wants to own a gun what do you have to hide.;neutral
I don't have anything to hide.;negative
But I do have the right to privacy;positive
The right to privacy is an illusion, I know American government probably the UK and other governments as well monitor what we do on the internet, Facebook etc, CCTV on streetcorners and in bars and shops etc all of these things take away our right to privacy, we are monitored from cradle to grave that is the price of living in the 21st century.;negative
From what i've managed to find out if you want finance to buy a house or car a background check is run on you which is stricter than the background check on buying firearms, I hope thats incorrect but if it isn't the check should at least be as strict and unless you plan on living on the street or with your parents forever your right to privacy has gone the moment the background check for a houseloan or credit card is done.;negative
The Internet is public when you put something on the Internet anyone can see it not just the government.;neutral
CCTV on street corners isn't invasion of privacy either because street corners are public and you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a public place.;negative
However documents such as medical records are privet and only doctors are allowed to see them and must have your permission before they share them with other doctors.;negative
The current background checks for fire arms check mental health, criminal history, and in some states even grades, what els needs checking?;negative
The current background checks for fire arms check mental health, criminal history, and in some states even grades, what els needs checking?;negative
only in some shops and if not done nothing happens...;negative
No it's federal law that you have to run background checks in order to keep your FFL (federal firearms license) which allows you to legally sell guns.;neutral
People selling guns illegally don't and won't no matter what laws you pass.;negative
Laws only stop the law abiding.;negative
nothing happens if don't do those checks.;negative
Only 0.00058% (44 ) of sells done even after were persecuted.;negative
so US pretty much has no gun law at all.;neutral
So then the problem isn't lack of laws it's lack of enforcement how do more laws change that?;negative
"""Destructive sanctions"".";neutral
$100 000 per illegally sold gun and up to 5 years in prison.;negative
"Allowing ""provocateurs""... after few moths no one would try anything...";negative
Having a law without enforcement is exactly same as not having any at all...;negative
Right so we need to focus on increasing enforcement not laws.;neutral
"You need ""law enforcing law"" :D";neutral
No you need enforceable laws, how are the authority's supposed to know whether or not the shop owner ran a background check?;negative
bind number of weapons sold on number of checks done if a difference found good bye $100 000 and hello group homo sex in shower :D;negative
I'm assuming those numbers would be imputed manually because that's how sales numbers are recorded so there is virtually no way to be sure the documents weren't falsified.;negative
and on top of that the cops would need a search warrant to obtain those records because business records are privet.;negative
Which means they would need enough probable cause which would be very difficult because police aren't trained usually for this sort of investigation.;negative
tax office has access to any business records of US companies...;neutral
They operate by a different set of rules than law enforcement besides documents can and have been falsified.;neutral
"What I meant is that the only thing you need to add to the tax office law is a word ""police/FBI"" to the line that defines who has access to the records.";negative
It a working system with working law, no need for new one.;positive
DO you know that it's still illegal to have a weapon without registration in Somalia?;negative
:D ...it's quite similar in US, you have gun law too... but no one gives a shit.;negative
The tax office isn't law enforcement so they aren't addressed by the 4th amendment.;negative
Law enforcement is what is addressed as being restricted by the 4th amendment.;negative
For the police to see those documents they need to obtain a court order search warrant.;neutral
And the problem is people who break that law and don't run background checks don't advertise that fact usually they lie on paper so the tax office would have no way to know or reason to suspect.;negative
Scout posted on the other side that Psych tests are not included in the majority of background checks;negative
Tests aren't but any and all diagnoses are.;negative
For example Adam Lanza tried to buy guns two weeks before the shooting but was turned down because he was diagnosed bipolar.;negative
Dont you think Psych tests are quite an important test for someone wanting to buy a weapon?;negative
If the psych test yielded results like a diagnoses then the diagnoses will be listed and made available and that's the important part.;negative
Republican are paid by weapons lobby so they have to follow what their employers tells them.;negative
They want to sell more weapons no matter that the buyers is a retard, psycho or criminal... :D;negative
Democrats voted against the bill as well.;negative
It wasnt just the Republicans.;negative
yeah how many from how many?;positive
:D :D;neutral
Uh, what are you asking?;neutral
Here are the ones who defected:;neutral
"Republicans who defected and voted ""yes"":";neutral
Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey;neutral
Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk;neutral
Maine Sen. Susan Collins;neutral
Arizona Sen. John McCain;neutral

North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp;neutral
Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor;neutral
Alaska Sen. Mark Begich;neutral

Out of interest have the figures been made public yet, just interested as this is nearly always portrayed as a Democrat vs Republican issue;negative
There were 54 yea and 46 nay.;negative
4 Republicans voted yea and 5 democrats voted nay, against their party lines.;negative
Everyone else voted with their respective parties.;negative
Yes.;neutral
Mentally ill and felons have no business owning guns.;negative
What if the mentally ill person goes psychotic and shoots people?;neutral
I bet y'all would support background checks then.;neutral
Background checks for gun ownership is no gun control.;negative
Stop whining, conservatives.;negative
America needs strict gun control.;neutral
The gun violence in America is an anathema.;neutral
It's pointless people with criminal backgrounds aren't buying guns from gun stores (all of which already run background checks) there are no background checks on the black market and laws won't change that.;negative
but why to make it easier for them?;neutral
What about retards or psychos?;neutral
Ut what about retards and psycos;neutral
Mental health records (if they exists for the individual) are checked already.;negative
but why make it easier for them;neutral
Who?;neutral
Checks are done only by licensed shops and nobody prosecutes them for selling it even if buyer did not passed only 0.00058% of felons are persecuted, that is about same chance that you get hit by meteorite.;negative
6 600 000 weapons were sold without checks in 2012 that is more than whole middle east.;negative
No.;neutral
The problem is not more background checks, but just including records into the one we have now.;negative
A majority of back-ground checks don't include psych tests because the government doesn't make those records available or just doesn't make them at all.;negative
We don't need to make new laws, we just need to enforce the ones we have now.;negative
I posted on the other side because from what we are led to believe is that background checks for buying a gun in America is very basic your idea of making them more thorough makes sense and why pass new legislation when you can just make the existing work better.;negative
Warrior posted that Psych tests are included, this is were it gets confusing for me not being American and not being 100% up on the laws etc.;negative
"Psych tests are ""included"", but very weakly.";negative
They are not included often enough because of a lot of doctor/patient confidentiality, or the records are hidden in files the background check can't get to.;negative
The majority of those living with a psychiatric condition are non-violent, and are actually at greater risk of being victims of violence rather than its perpetrators.;negative
A considerable about of day to day gun violence is committed by people who are not diagnosed with any condition, or whose diagnose is not directly relevant to the crime committed.;positive
"The only obvious exception to that rule would be spree killers and mass shooters, for whom the majority do have a relevant diagnosis; however, these persons represent an incredibly small fraction of those with psychiatric conditions.";negative
Mental health screenings as requisites to gun ownership are highly prejudicial and violate the constitutional rights to equal protection and gun ownership without valid reason.;negative
Moreover, penalizing those who have taken responsibility for their mental health and sought treatment only further discourages those who have not sought out care from doing so.;negative
The implication is not only damaging for the general population living with undiagnosed mental health conditions, but exacerbates the problem of shootings by not getting people into care who need it.;negative
Any time gun control increases, our personal freedoms decrease.;negative
I think the government should stop hurting its' citizens and focus on ways to actually increase quality of life.;negative
Oh, I know.;positive
Let's start with the economy.;neutral
Any time gun control increases, our personal freedoms decrease.;negative
Just BS, countries with the highest living standards has much more complex gun laws.;positive
.;neutral
They have had time to stabilize, for one.;neutral
Two, should the need to rise up against their government ever become an issue, what will they use?;neutral
Knives and sticks?;neutral
It's not as BS as you think.;negative
My point, however, was to focus on more major issues first.;negative
Then we can move on to petty gun laws.;neutral
I should probably point out that I was arguing from a USA only perspective.;negative
What works for other countries wouldn't necessarily work here.;negative
I'm sorry dear redneck but times when you could take over country with rifles and horses is long gone.;negative
How exactly you use your AR15 to take down F22?;negative
Or how to use AK to take down B2?;neutral
Our 2nd Amendment secures our right to bear arms as a means to defend ourselves.;positive
In a situation such as you describe, the Ar-15 and AK would be used to fight to aquire and secure larger weapons as needed.;negative
Just as not everyone had a cannon of their own during the Civil War, when the war was on... the people on both sides found ways to get them.;negative
and you learn how to fly a jet from Wikipedia ... I assume, how would you stop a group of tanks?;negative
RPG does not harm it, Javelin cannot target it... it's just idiotic fallacy that you can stand against government fed in you by weapons manufacturer like some kind of marketing.;negative
Iraq had the 4th biggest professional army on the whole world with jets, tanks heavy weapons... , it took 3 week to completely fuck them up.;negative
For how long you think would isolated groups of rednecks with cheap rifles survive?;neutral
2 days or 3?;neutral
You don't seem to be aware of the fact that our nations has a large number of prior service military in our citizenry.;negative
We don't loose our military knowledge and training when we finish our time in service.;negative
(We bring it home with us.);positive
You also seem to un-aware of the fact that (in a conflict like you are describing) many of our military would defect to fight with 'the people' and they would likely bring their tanks, planes and other weapons with them when they do.;negative
Just like we've witnessed in Syria, Iran and other uprisings.;negative
Very few of you were in Army, fat losers who server 8 years ago in some kitchen is somehow magically quipped with knowledge of taking out battleships....yeah;negative
Nobody would deflect because you would be presented as terrorists, bombed from distance, all of you would be dead in few hours you wouldn't even made it to face to face.;negative
Syria is AK vs AK no one is trained, no actual army very different situation.;negative
Iran is completely different.;neutral
Keep thinking that everyone who served in the military (ARMY?);negative
are fat losers who can't fight.;negative
Keep thinking that none of our sons and daughters who are now in the the military and following in our footsteps would ever defect and fight with us and not against us.;negative
I'll keep hoping we won't have to learn which one of us has it right.;positive
good luck dodging drones and tomahawks :D :D;positive
Why would I have to worry about dodging drones and tomahawks?;negative
Considering we're still going at it 8 years later against a small group of isolated terrorists armed with cheap rifles in Afghanastan, I'd wager we'd last quite some time even without the B2s and tanks we'd be capturing along our way.;negative
Its not like the stuff we capture has to survive for very long anyway, just long enough to do some damage and then we can destroy it and we've still made a net gain.;negative
The military isn't the government.;negative
Some might even be sympathetic to tearing down the government if it was corrupt enough.;negative
Who knows, this is all speculative.;negative
But stranger wars have been won, I suppose.;negative
Oh, and attacking my character to prove your point is so last decade.;neutral
Even ignoring such grander scales, just having a gun to defend myself against someone wishing to kill me in turn is enough.;negative
When you limit such options, more people will die near the beginning of such a change.;negative
It is the way humans are.;neutral
You know USA is the only place on earth where a guy can wake up go to a barbershop shoot 4 people then go to a car wash to kill another 2 (true story).;negative
Yet after all the random shootings you still think guns are ok.;neutral
I don't understand your mindset.;negative
"""Petty gun laws"" do you know how many innocent children and people die every year from ""petty guns""?";negative
Do you realize how easy is it is for me or anyone to get a gun for dirt cheap and come kill you?;negative
Very.;positive
As for rising to the government with guns your the reason so many people die.;neutral
Obviously if you rise up with guns they'll use guns as well.;positive
If you rise up with sticks and knifes they'll use sticks and knifes.;neutral
Your just creating the problem;neutral
Unless you have unique insight into the very depths of my mind, I would tread lightly around such words as 'you are the reason' and other such things.;negative
Yes, you could get a gun pretty easily and try to kill me.;negative
But I would have a gun to defend myself from people with such psychotic tendencies.;negative
You also seem to assume that the instant someone handles a gun, they become a raging psychotic murderer.;negative
I'm afraid that such people with those tendencies are a very small percentage of gun owners as a whole.;negative
To use logic like yours, you are the reason why so many people are ignorant of guns and the good they can do.;negative
You narrow your mind to only accept the bad, and with it you weaken yourself.;negative
Perhaps I just have the perspective required to see the truth of things.;positive
I don't know.;neutral
But I do know that no matter what I do, guns or otherwise, people will kill each other for stupid reasons.;negative
I don't care if it's by gun, stick, knife, or bare fists.;negative
People will kill each other because they can.;neutral
If you cannot accept this truth, perhaps you should keep your head buried in the sand.;negative
Guns are tools, they don't have a life of their own, only a person with a mind to kill will kill, and it doesn't matter whether they use a gun, a knife, a baseball bat, or a shrapnel bomb.;negative
I personally find it surprising that anti-gun people are so fixated on guns, a knife is just as deadly, and a bomb kills far more people.;negative
What does it matter what tool a murderer uses to accomplish those ends?;neutral
In the end, people are killed, or injured.;negative
That's what matters.;neutral
Banning one tool will only cause the inclined to use a different one in it's stead, or acquire it illegally.;negative
"What I find most amusing however, is that most ""mass shootings"" occur in, can you believe it?";positive
GUN FREE ZONES!;positive
"When you disarm a populace, you create a ""shooting fish in a barrel"" scenario for a murderer.";negative
Who's going to be able to stop someone shooting people up, if the people are completely unarmed?;neutral
Criminals avoid locations where police are present for this very reason.;negative
That's why it's better to have an armed populace present anywhere there might be a shooting, rather than relying on 911 to dispatch the police who are 20-30 minutes way.;negative
Regarding rising up against the government: Why in the world would an oppressive government send their military to use sticks and knives against a rebelling populace using the same weapons, when they could instead deploy far more effective weapons (guns), and mow down the entire uprising with impunity and no casualties?;negative
It doesn't matter what we use, an oppressive government will use the most deadly weapons in it's arsenal, why in the world would they fight fair?;negative
An armed populace needs to have equal firepower to an oppressive government, otherwise they will be immediately suppressed by far superior firepower.;negative
Every single right we have is subject to restriction, and validly so when there are competing rights claims.;negative
"This is why one cannot shout ""fire"" in a crowded theater when there is no fire.";negative
In the case of gun restrictions, the competing rights are the rights to personal well-being and the to life which are fairly compelling as far as rights go.;positive
"It is a logical fallacy to assert that the government can either address gun violence or the economy; it can do both.";positive
Would be an invasion of privacy and would likely not work anyway.;neutral

Watch the part at 1:48 about the professional criminal who advocates gun control heavily because it will create less competition.;neutral
If you are for gun control, you need to rethink your life;neutral
A lot of people don't understand that there is a protection aspect of having a gun.;negative
These videos show that.;neutral
Note: I think the guy in the red jacket is totally fake.;negative
But, the videos of people defending themselves is very real.;positive
Does it matter if he is fake?;negative
His point still stands: Criminals WANT gun control so that citizens are not able to stop them from doing whatever they do.;negative
Also, when seconds matter, the police are only minutes away.;negative
Yes, it does matter.;neutral
That tactic is used by liberals to ban guns.;negative
The truth is the defense against libs, not silly lies.;negative
How?;neutral
How are liberals using the excuse of criminals wanting guns to go illegal to ban guns?;neutral
What the fuck did you just say?;neutral
Lying.;neutral
Read the second sentence.;neutral
I say something in the first sentence.;neutral
If you don't understand what I am saying, keep reading.;neutral
The second sentence explained that the truth can beat libs and we don't need to make stuff up.;neutral
how is it being made up?;neutral
it is extremely logical for criminals to want to have guns illegal seeing as how they already have unregistered guns, why the fuck would a criminal register their gun or even want to have their gun registered or even have other civilians having guns?;negative
you are not making logical sense here, put your feet in the shoes of the criminal, do you want other people to have guns?;negative
no you really dont;negative
Put your feet in the shoes of someone who reads.;neutral
I didn't say why I thought it was fake.;negative
I said it was fake.;negative
You asked why it mattered if it is fake.;negative
You shouldn't use fake stuff just because you think it accurately portrays a viewpoint you want to demonstrate.;negative
That doesn't mean they didn't have a fake person speaking.;negative
I didn't say that criminals wouldn't be happy that they would be charged with less crimes if caught, I just said that it is bad to put a fake criminal in a video.;negative
Here are some of the problems I have:;neutral
Nobody says they are in the business of murder.;negative
Criminals don't refer to what they do as a business like he did.;negative
Someone dressed in a hood would not refer to his friends as associates.;negative
i dont think you understand the street life very well.;positive
it does NOT mater if the guy was an actor or not, the point that he made still stands: criminals do not want other citizens to have guns, its as simple as that you cant argue against it;negative
and he didnt even say killing, he said home invasions.;negative
Seriously?!?!?!;neutral
"The three words after he says home invasions is ""mostly, some murder""";neutral
He was listing off his jobs.;negative
You couldn't listen for 3 more words?;negative
"It was literally 3 words, unless you count the ""uh"" sound.";negative
If he isn't real, the fact that he isn't real will outweigh his point and no one will care if it is an accurate portrayal.;negative
Yes, criminals don't want the general population armed.;negative
I am not saying otherwise.;negative
You don't understand street life, so this is stupid.;negative
You did not say that in your last argument let me find it ill edit this with it;negative
You actually said the exact opposite;neutral
Dude, how many times do I have to tell you to read before you start actually reading?;negative
Just by reading that i can tell you missed the ENTIRE point dude.;negative
so until you figure out what I am talking about, im not going to respond to you;negative
Hey!;neutral
I made a point first.;neutral
You argued against my point.;negative
You can't accuse me of missing the point, I am the one who decided what the point was.;negative
If criminals would want gun control putting a fake criminal in the video is a bad idea.;negative
If criminals don't want gun control putting a fake criminal in the video is a bad idea.;negative
I was adding another reason why criminals wouldn't want gun control.;negative
So then maybe he wasnt fake, me and you do not know, criminals usually have a huge ego, right?;negative
so maybe he was priding himself about what he does;neutral
i can see how putting a fake criminal advocating for gun control is weird, but if you were to ask any criminal/thug on the street are you for gun control/regulation i assure you they will say most definitely yes.;negative
If i stick up a law abiding citizen in a world where guns are tightly controlled and there are no conceal carrry laws, then i know almost for a fact he will not pull a gun on me, and i will be the one with the gun.;negative
Why do you think gun free zones are the biggest targets for shootings?;negative
Because there is noone there to stop them;neutral
Awesome, this didn't actually have anything to do with what I posted.;negative
Ego or not, I don't think they talk like that.;negative
Good, we agree a fake criminal is a bad idea.;negative
I am against gun control.;negative
It is stupid tactics like this that are helping them take away my rights.;negative
If you lie to get your way it doesn't help your cause.;neutral
You have a great video of people defending themselves because they were armed.;positive
We need to show that aspect of guns.;negative
"But, in the middle of these good videos is a terribly fake sounding ""criminal"" that makes people think the rest of the videos are fake.";negative
I see now what you mean by propaganda, i thought you were talking about that being liberal propaganda, which is why i couldn't make sense of your arguments.;negative
I apologize;neutral
Damn it man.;neutral
Why couldn't you come to this conclusion sooner?;negative
im hard headed i guess....;negative
lol;neutral
Do they actually?;neutral
An unregulated gun economy makes acquisition of firearms easier for criminals as well, whereas tighter control restricts the number of unregistered firearms while keeping registered firearms in the hands of people arguably more likely to use them responsibly.;negative
I have no idea what an unregulated gun economy looks like.;negative
I don't think you do either.;neutral
"The debate is phrased in absolutes (for control or against it); I was rolling with that.";negative
I recognize that there is not really an unregulated gun economy.;neutral
At any rate, that was a miniscule part of the point I was making.;negative
Ok, fine.;positive
But, when you talk about absolutes like that it doesn't help with the discussion.;neutral
To be entirely fair, when one frames a debate in absolutes one might expect responses in absolutes.;negative
I've already conceded I should not have spoken in absolutes, but in truth it is far easier to slip into them when the entire framework is premised in them.;negative
Do you really honestly believe that professional criminals go to the GUN STORE to get guns??;positive
AHAHAHAHA;neutral
Dude its called the black market, get with the times man cmon now lets not be silly;negative
And by gun control, also, they are trying to make only muzzle loaders, handguns, and shotguns available to the general public;negative
No.;neutral
I honestly believe that legally purchased and licensed guns which are stolen or misplaced fuel the black market.;positive
Or did you think they showed up there by magic?;neutral
Regarding types of guns, I am not familiar with what that excludes but I see no reason why anyone needs to own any gun that is not a self-defense or hunting firearm.;negative
that is completely besides the point, a criminal, with a criminal background, is going to have an unregistered gun.;negative
/;neutral
if a law passes saying you need to register your guns, do you REALLY think they are going to comply with that law?;negative
Verbatim what I already said to your argument:;neutral
No.;neutral
I honestly believe that legally purchased and licensed guns which are stolen or misplaced fuel the black market.;positive
Or did you think they showed up there by magic?;neutral
Try again.;positive
Or better yet, don't, and stop wasting my time.;neutral
Reality check.;neutral
Pay attention.;neutral
Crooks don't require legal access to guns.;neutral
They don't obey the law, so they'll get their hands on one, no matter how many laws there are.;negative
We need to make it a capital offense to use a gun in the commission of a crime.;negative
That would really put a damper on things.;negative
If you are going to dredge up a 100 day old debate, the least you could do is read my response to the people who have already made your argument.;negative
"An unregulated gun economy means more guns are in circulation; the black market is full of legally purchased and licensed guns which were stolen or misplaced.";negative
Or did you think they showed up there by magic?;neutral
Making use of firearms in commission of a crime a capital offense is simply asinine.;negative
It is not only grossly disproportionate, but there is no reason to believe that deterrence is actually effective (and there is plenty of evidence that there are decidedly more effective alternatives).;negative
Gun are used over 1 million times a year to stop criminals.;negative
No wonder they want them outlawed.;neutral
I agree that there is a protection method, but it can also be used as an outlet for anger or depression.;negative
More guns on the street may lead for guns to become a more prevalent outlet for stress.;negative
I can make unsubstantiated claims as well.;positive
As an outlet for anger and depression guns can help people cope in hard times.;neutral
They can go to shooting ranges and shoot their guns and feel better.;negative
Since they feel better there is less need for doctors to prescribe them medicine.;negative
Thus, health care costs will go down if there are more guns.;negative
Let's stick to stuff that actually happens.;negative
I agree, indeed one can go to a shooting range or an open field an fire their weapon, but phrasing your last sentence in the manner of non-applicability is illogical.;negative
Are you saying that one won't shoot another person out of anger or shoot themselves in times of heavy depression?;neutral
Try this links out that show that guns serve as an outlet for stress.;neutral
They can be harmful to others.;neutral
Evidence 1;neutral
Evidence 2;neutral
Evidence 3;neutral
"So saying "" Let's stick to stuff that actually happens.""";negative
is utterly foolish.;negative
These things ACTUALLY happen.;neutral
If I find an article in the news where someone was so happy after shooting at a gun range that they no longer needed medication would that make my argument correct?;negative
I didn't say your argument was incorrect.;negative
The statement you concluded your previous argument with was foolish since these things happen.;neutral
I rest my case unless you have more to add.;negative
Your 3 articles do not indicate that the abundance of guns leads to guns being used in stressful times in the general sense.;negative
There is no reason to believe that an increase in guns will cause an increase in stressful violence.;negative
There is nothing to indicate that the stress wouldn't have lead to a knife death or beating death in the absence of a gun.;negative
All you know is that stress causes violence.;negative
Please, fucking read.;neutral
"I purposefully said ""MAY lead"" as in it's probable.";positive
There are obviously more ways to get guns then there were back in the 1950's and such.;negative
I have given you the article to show you what MAY happen.;neutral
In which case they already have.;neutral
Yes, stress causes violence, I agree, but a gun is an outlet for anger.;negative
Just because you have an idea doesn't make it probable.;negative
Doesn't help your argument at all.;negative
There is still no reason to believe the gun is an outlet for anger.;negative
Violence was the outlet for anger.;negative
It already happen twit.;neutral
I just said that.;neutral
Why the fuck did you leave that out?;negative
That was the purpose of the articles.;neutral
Sure, lets go with that.;positive
What the fuck?;neutral
Did you read any of the articles?;neutral
Shooting somebody is violent.;negative
They shot their victims out of ANGER.;neutral
Clarify yourself.;neutral
You can't justify your use of the word probable.;negative
Make sense now?;neutral
It doesn't matter what tool was used to commit the violence.;neutral
You have a link to violence only.;neutral
You shouldn't make conclusions about guns because of those articles.;negative
What does this have to do with guns being an outlet for anger.;neutral
Yes it does.;neutral
A gun is much quicker than using your hands or a knife.;neutral
I have linked GUN VIOLENCE with anger.;negative
I have proved that guns serve as an outlet of anger.;negative
That's all that was required of me to do.;negative
Why are you trying to make new claims that have no ground?;negative
If I get mad and shoot someone should I just ignore that fact that I used a gun?;negative
No.;neutral
I choose the gun.;neutral
Why?;negative
That's what we wish to know.;neutral
Why the gun?;neutral
Is it quicker?;neutral
More intimidating?;negative
What?;neutral
It completely relevant to my argument.;positive
Your job is to disprove my notion that guns serve as an outlet of anger which you have yet to do.;negative
If you can't assess such a simple ass point then don't bother pestering me.;negative
You said something will probably happen.;neutral
You don't know that.;neutral
No, you linked someone who happened to use a gun.;neutral
No, you have only proven anger in general.;neutral
Not if you want to extrapolate and take away other peoples rights.;negative
Since when are you against making claims that have no ground?;neutral
";)";neutral
Absolutely.;neutral
We don't do that ridiculous idea with anything else.;negative
Why is shooting someone magically a whole different type of violence?;negative
When someone is beaten do we care if it was punching violence or kicking violence?;negative
It might be if you ever actually figured it out.;neutral
Your argument doesn't even support your case.;negative
If someone just chose a gun because it was convenient, that means they want to commit violence, not gun violence.;negative
You haven't demonstrated that it was the gun that was the outlet.;negative
You have demonstrated anger was an outlet.;neutral
You haven't proven your claim, it is still on you.;neutral
It already did.;neutral
Why the fuck can you not realize that?;negative
Okay you're just a fucking twit.;negative
They were angry.;negative
They used a damn gun as an outlet of their anger.;negative
Why the fuck can you not realize that?;negative
No, I have given you evidence showing that guns can serve as an outlet for anger.;neutral
They clearly did in the articles.;neutral
This isn't even what I'm talking about.;negative
My only claim is that guns can serve as an outlet for anger.;negative
That's it.;neutral
They do.;neutral
Case closed.;neutral
I see.;positive
I have given you evidence of which you have yet to prove incorrect.;neutral
I have given you a notion you keep trying to dodge and you are saying I have no ground?;negative
You're thay damn headstrong abiut debating that you become ignorant.;negative
Because it a new type of violence?;neutral
Same thing with bullying and cyber bullying.;negative
They are both still bullying.;neutral
One is a sub-type.;neutral
One is the general category.;neutral
Wtf?;neutral
If I want to call people names on the internet am I cyber bullying or just bullying?;negative
No.;neutral
Anger was an outlet to what?;neutral
The emotional response will trigger the physical response in this situation.;positive
You're a dumbass.;neutral
If I become sad my outlet for my sadness may be writting down things in a journal.;negative
It I am happy my outlet for happiness may be partying or dancing or jumping or exercising.;positive
If I'm angry my outlet of anger may be to go boxing or hunting.;negative
Some people are bold enough to go grab a gun and shoot someone.;neutral
That is an outlet.;positive
Anger is the stress and then you find your way to manage it.;positive
My claim is this:;neutral
Guns may serve as an outlet for anger?;negative
How so?;neutral
When someone is mad they may grab a gun and shoot someone.;negative
When has this ever occured?;neutral
Plenty of times (this is the place for the article to show that some angry people will go grab a gun and shoot someone).;negative
What is your rebuttal?;neutral
"Like I said before ""You can't justify your use of the word probable. """;negative
Having it happen a handful of times does not mean it is very likely to happen.;negative
They used violence.;neutral
Why don't people just fire into the air?;negative
If guns were the actual outlet things would be better.;neutral
People would drive to their gun range and fire until the anger went away.;neutral
You have presented a story where someone needed to hurt someone because of their anger, not that they needed to shoot someone.;negative
It was initially what you were talking about.;neutral
I did prove incorrect.;neutral
If you call people names on the internet are you trying to be mean or are you specifically trying to make the internet mean?;negative
Sorry, I meant to use the word violence, not anger.;negative
Do you do pen journaling or pencil.;neutral
If you are right, that should matter.;positive
You have not demonstrated any reason why there should be special rules for different types of violence.;negative
Why is a gun death worse than a knife death?;negative
Why is a stab wound not as bad as a gun shot?;negative
"Like I said before ""You can't justify your use of the word probable.";negative
"""Having it happen a handful of times does not mean it is very likely to happen.";negative
Okay?;neutral
Does that mean it didn't happen?;neutral
No.;neutral
Does this prove that guns aren't an outlet of anger?;negative
They used a gun.;neutral
"I haven't heart a criminal admit to killing someone with ""violence"".";negative
They will usually explain what they killed them with.;neutral
This still doesn't prove that guns aren't an outlet for anger.;negative
I'd love to know.;positive
"So a hoodlum will actually spend time driving to a firing range when the people around him will mostly likely be telling him to ""cap his ass""?";negative
No.;neutral
Prove this claim of yours.;neutral
I have presented three stories where someones rage drove them to want to shoot someone.;negative
This doesn't disprove my notion.;negative
Oh really?;neutral
Go ahead and restate your counter argument please.;neutral
That doesn't even make sense.;negative
Answer my question.;neutral
That makes more sense, but clarity in violence is key to determining how the victim was killed or harmed.;neutral
"This is why there is a term called ""gun violence"".";negative
What?;neutral
What does it matter?;neutral
Did you even understand the allusion?;negative
What rules?;neutral
I have classified types of violence.;neutral
I have not compared different types of injury at all.;negative
I never said one was worse than the other.;negative
It means you didn't prove anything.;neutral
A gun being used doesn't prove anything.;negative
You still have the burden of proof.;neutral
We put people on trial for murder, not murder with gun, murder with knife, murder with fists.;negative
Because guns aren't an outlet for anger.;neutral
None of your examples had hoodlums in it.;negative
Hoodlums aren't doing it out of anger.;negative
I answered with a question.;neutral
Cyber bullying is done to be a bully, not to make the internet a bad place.;negative
You act as if guns are used to make guns look bad.;negative
The term gun violence is usually used in a very stupid way.;negative
Why doesn't it matter what instrument you use to write your journal, but it matters what instrument you use to commit violence?;negative
Then why make the special case of banning guns?;neutral
Incorrect.;neutral
I have made my claim.;neutral
I have presented evidence supporting it.;positive
You keep trying to bring the debate in another direction.;neutral
The burden of proof to prove that guns serve as an outlet for anger?;negative
The articles already did that.;neutral
Angry people who used guns and killed somebody.;neutral
That's it.;neutral
So what was the outlet of anger in the articles I presented?;negative
You are avoiding the burden of proof.;neutral
"The ""hoodlem"" thing was only a mere allusion to hint at a greater social truth behind shootings.";negative
Prove you previous claim please otherwise it's dismissed as bullshit.;positive
You don't understand shit that I post.;negative
The purpose was to show what gunviolence is still violence, but it has its own category like domestic violence.;negative
It's a label for a certain type of violence.;neutral
I never said guns make anybody look bad.;negative
I only want to show you that guns are an outlet for anger.;negative
I have shown yow how they are.;negative
You just dismiss my case each time.;negative
I'm not continuing this unless you can actually assess evidence.;negative
Irrelevant and disagree.;neutral
Writing in my journal doesn't harm anyone.;negative
It's pointless to determine what tool I used.;negative
It doesn't prove or disprove my case.;negative
It's irrelevant matter.;neutral
How many time must I tell you that all I am saying is that guns serve as an outlet for anger?;negative
Can you please stick to that?;positive
Otherwise I'm out.;negative
You have shown that guns have been used when someone is angry a few times.;negative
Why should we draw conclusions about what the entire population is allowed to have based on that?;negative
Yes.;neutral
That all.;neutral
Guns may be used as an outlet for anger.;negative
Everybody will not use a gun.;negative
You are completely correct.;neutral
I'm sure even most people would never use a gun.;negative
You just have the few that will.;neutral
They will use the gun as an outlet for anger.;negative
I'm not saying limit the population on anything.;negative
Thay is a separate debate.;neutral
For this initial dispute all I wanted to show was that guns can be used as an outlet for anger.;negative
That's all I am saying.;neutral
Have we drawn to a conclusion?;neutral
Uh, no.;negative
That is the debate.;positive
I don't see where the debate is asking if guns have ever been used in anger.;negative
"The debate title says ""Extremely serious debate"".";neutral
That's it.;neutral
All I did was comment on your post.;neutral
That's it.;neutral
The debate doesn't ask anything.;negative
Fine.;neutral
I will agree you didn't know.;neutral
I am talking about the column options.;neutral
Gun control or not for gun control.;neutral
Didn't know what?;negative
I simply commented on your post.;negative
That was it.;neutral
I don't understand what your problem is.;negative
The problem is that you came on an extremely serious debate to apparently just tell us someone has used a gun in anger before.;negative
I was using the debate to discuss things on a larger level, like more than 4 people.;neutral
"The voice over for the guy in the ""Red Hoodie"" IS A BULLSHIT AND A LIE, I know street thugs and they do not talk like that, the voice over is a made up lie by some anti gun control nut bag, most likely the NRA.";negative
However I am for the right to own a gun but also feel that a better systems needs to be in place to keep guns away from the unstable.;neutral
I will blow a motherfuckers head clean off there shoulders if someone ever tried to harm me or my family with a gun, that being said I hate guns and I do wish the world can live without them but realistically that is not going to happen so if you own a gun then so will I, for protection only.;negative
You really think criminals, who already have unregisterted guns, want other citizens to have them?;negative
If I was a criminal, and I used a gun, I would want guns to be controlled so that there is a far, far, far less chance of being shot while i rob/rape/murder;negative
Did you even read my post?;neutral
I said I am for guns but still want better of control to keep guns away from crazy people, the thing is there are a lot of gun owners that are just as unstable as the criminals that they want to defend themselves against, my point is no one that is unstable should own a gun.;negative
My list of people that should not own a gun:;negative
1.;neutral
people with any metal instability.;neutral
2.;neutral
people with anger issues,alcoholics and drug addicts.;negative
3.;neutral
any and all fundamentalist of any cult or religion.;neutral
4.;neutral
children.;neutral
I feel that if you want to own a gun that person should undergo a series of psychological exams, I mean we require those test for people to get a drivers license, both physical and mental but why not guns?;negative
Another thing is make it law that every gun in American needs to have a GPS tracking chip, to me this is a more then fair compromise for all gun owners, Americans need to find a balance for gun owners that still keep our freedom in tacked but at the same time keep everyone safe, if every American owned a gun we would turn back to the Wild Wild West where gun is law and in a sense ripping true American freedom away for everybody.;negative
"And another thing, ""No JOB NO GUN"" poverty fuels violence.";negative
you said you know the guy talking in the red hoodie IS A BULLSHIT AND A LIE, because you know how thugs talk.;negative
"Thats stupid thugs dont have certain vocalizations, and if you are implying that a ""thug"" uses street lingo or whatever, then that is just the stupidest assumption you will ever make and you will get stuck up one day with that mentality because you will think this guy is not a threat, and he is.";negative
why cant children own a gun?;neutral
in a part 2 of that video there is a 14 year old girl, home alone.;negative
who saved herself from 3 teen male intruders;neutral
And also, if that guy was the NRA, dont you think they would PUSH FOR GUNS FOR EVERYONE?;negative
You know seeing as how that is what they are all about and everything??;neutral
I agree with number 1 and 2.;neutral
"""Number 3, fundamentalists can use different and more damaging means that a semi automatic gun, so by excluding these people you are only creating a mentality of us vs them";negative
and 4, children who can pass a safety course should be able to have .22's and .17's but not for personal carry;neutral
How young are we talking about here?;neutral
I mean a 12 year old should not own a gun the same way they shouldn't drink alcohol or drive a truck down the interstate lol.;negative
As for the guy in the red Hoodie, I think that came out wrong, I am sure there are people like the guy in the video but the likelihood of a person that thinks like that would most likely be uneducated, ghetto or some rebel outlaw, you are right that could of been the real guy talking but the likelihood is very low, reason is the person interviewing that guy is required by law to report any person that speaks or threatens another with violence, the documentary recorder would been changed with harboring a fugitive same as a physiologist would be held accountable if you told your shink you are thinking about killing someone, doctor patient confidentiality goes out the window when it comes to the safely of others.;negative
"Very true fundamentalist would most likely use a different means of action but because of that is the reason they should not own a gun, that's like saying just because I like to kill people with my swords so owning a gun is A OK so long as I don't get my hands of any swords, and yes it is ""US VS Them"" the insane vs sane.";negative
like 12 years old young, but i mean my cousin got his first gun at 10 he was the youngest guy to go through the course thingy.;negative
But i mnean with all the games online today maybe kids shouldnt be able to own like a little .22 or a 28g shotgun, something small that they can go hunt with you know?;positive
Or if they are ever home alone and their parents explain to them why they have their own gun in the house is so that they can defend themselves while at home, it might be ok...;neutral
And i did not know that.;negative
Then do you think documentaries like Drugs, Inc. do the cameramen report the kingpins and shit or are the people like undercover or what, i dont understand how you would be free from showing all of your drugs on national television....;negative
idk.;neutral
The insane vs the sane?;neutral
cmon now everyones a little crazy;neutral
It's only required by law if it's bottley harming to self and others, drugs do not apply.;negative
Example if your best friend tells you he raped and killed his girlfriend and you say nothing you will be considered just as guilty as your friend because it was a rape and murder.;negative
And true I am crazy lol but I don't think that I am mentally unstable, there is a big difference, crazy is Jim Carry, nuts or mentally unstable is Charly Manson.;negative
I am in relative agreement with you, except for the standards you set with respect to restricting ownership.;positive
About all I agree with you on is children.;positive
Here is why:;neutral
"""Mental Instability""";neutral
Half of a given population will experience mental illness in their lifetime, and in any given year roughly a quarter of the population is diagnosable with mental illness.;negative
One in seventeen live with a chronic mental health condition.;neutral
Most of these people are not violent, and if they are it is not necessarily because of mental illness.;negative
In fact, those with mental illness are actually more likely to be victims of violence than those without mental illness, and are less likely to be perpetrators than victims.;negative
"There is no research that I am aware of that indicates an actual causal link between mental illness and violence; this is an unfounded stereotype that negatively stigmatizes those living with mental illness.";negative
To deny equal rights to people who have done nothing wrong, who are more likely to be victims, and who we have no actual reason to suspect will become violent is entirely unethical.;negative
This is especially true if you extend the restriction to any and all mental instability.;positive
Anger issues, alcoholics and drug addicts;negative
Anger issues I am more inclined to agree with, although assessing and screening for that is questionable in terms of efficacy.;negative
"What constitutes an ""anger issue""?";neutral
Is it established by psych eval, criminal history, etc?;negative
Excluding alcoholics and drug addicts I take more issue with, as again these populations are not to my knowledge actually demonstrably proven to be more violent (and, again, may actually be more likely to be victims of violence given concurrent patterns of poverty or homelessness).;negative
Fundamentalist Cults or Religion;neutral
Who defines what constitutes fundamentalist?;neutral
Do the beliefs really matter, or do we care if they are identified as gang or terrorist organization that actually supports and encourages violence?;negative
This standard seems exceptionally dangerous, as a punishment of freedom of speech, belief, and association.;negative
I have absolutely no idea what state you live in, but in no state that I have lived in are you required to get either a physical or mental exam for a drivers license.;negative
At any rate, psych exams are pretty easy to lie out of and don't really screen very well in my opinion.;positive
Accurate diagnosis are rare even with people who have been working extensively for an extended period of time with a trained professional.;negative
Other objections aside, this just isn't practical.;negative
These would definitely just get removed once they hit the black market.;negative
Also, a bit creepy a la big brother if you ask me.;neutral
Only bit of criticism I'll toss your way is this.;negative
That video with the criminal endorsing gun control was a scripted skit made to make a point.;negative
But the rest of the video brought up many great examples of how gun ownership brings crime down and makes people safer.;positive
Plus bonus points for using a video, always a favoret tactic of mine, to Many people on this sight post inks to long winded articles but showing is always better than telling.;negative
!!!!;neutral
NEW UPDATE INFO !!!!;neutral
Since I suck at being direct, let me explain this debate is about gun confiscation, and what the requirements would be to have one, or you can argue to take guns away.;negative
Stupid American.;neutral
"""I had to shoot him.";neutral
"I was me or my baby!""";negative
No it wasn't he broke into your house to steal.;neutral
He didnt deserve the death penalty.;negative
As for the guy saying that gun control reduces competition... in the UK if he was a known criminal he would be searched on the street for guns.;neutral
If he was found carrying a gun he would be locked up for around 5 years.;neutral
Gun control does not help criminals.;negative
LOL.;neutral
The man had another accomplice with him, don't you think two men, probably fucked up on drugs, if they saw a defenseless woman standing there, don't you think something like, oh idk, rape might happen?;negative
And you obviously aren't familiar with the great law of america that if anyone enters your property without permission, you are free to do what you choose to this invasion of your security.;negative
He would be a REALLY shitty criminal if cops knew who he was.;negative
And its hard to identify people with hoods on, hats, glasses, etc..;negative
.;neutral
If you are not from america then there is no way you can possibly fathom the amount of corruption and crime that runs rampant in our politics/corporations;negative
1) There was no evidence that he was on drugs 2) Since when does drugs turn a thief into someone who would harm a baby 3) There was no evidence he was going to rape her.;negative
I am familiar with your laws.;neutral
It is barbaric.;neutral
There is such a thing as a known criminal.;negative
I'm in Spain.;neutral
We have much bigger problems with corruption.;negative
This doesnt justify the public being permitted to hand out the death sentence to each other.;negative
You are right on all your points except for one my friend.;neutral
Is it barbaric to defend yourself?;neutral
how did this lady know they didnt have a gun or were unarmed?;neutral
They didnt, she was fearing for HER LIFE.;negative
Nice sympathy skills you got.;positive
Maybe people shouldnt just waltz through someones front door that they don't know, and maybe they won't get shot?;negative
just a thought.;neutral
LOL.;neutral
ts only if someone comes onto your property unannounced that you have the right to defend YOUR PROPERTY that they are INVADING;neutral
The basis of the law of self defence should be that you can use reasonable force equal to the threat your under.;positive
The guy probably would have just come in the house and stolen something.;negative
He did not deserve to die.;negative
When you enter a fortress unannounced you are probably going to get shot on sight.;negative
What is the difference from entering a privately owned business organization and them gunning you down on sight, LEGALLY of course.;negative
and a privately owned home who shoots you because they feel that their life is in danger?;neutral
The difference is that the privately owned business should have to detain you.;negative
Also, that is stupid logic.;negative
What if the guy had a bat and i had a gun?;neutral
Would i have to say oh shit sorry let me go get my bat from the basement instead of just shooting you (doesnt have to be a kill shot can be a maim shot, the lady had a shotgun, obviously its gonna kill the guy from so close, and yes, she could have maimed him and called the police.;negative
Well its the logic of the British legal system on which your law is based.;neutral
Of course you could use deadly force if you believed you were going to be killed by the guy with the bat.;negative
Ok, well welcome to the planet where there is a wide variety of countries and continents all with their own unique laws and logics.;positive
Its a matter of development of human rights.;neutral
USA is on the same level as Africa and some Latin American countries.;neutral
You'll catch up eventually, I hope.;positive
Which parts of Africa are talking about here?;neutral
Lol, human rights?;negative
what about common sense?;neutral
common sense tells me dont enter that house because you might get killed or put in the hospital.;negative
If someone entered YOUR house, Atrag, unarmed and meant you no physical harm at all whatsoever, then there goes self defense, because he is not there to harm you.;negative
He is just there to steal all your valuables.;positive
But you cant stop him because you aren't being threatened.;negative
So you might as well just stand there and strike up a nice convo while he puts all your things onto a moving van.;positive
If you want to support zoophilia sign this pitition.;negative
http://www.change.org/petitions/michigan-state-house-make-zoophilia-legal;neutral
Gun control is such a controversial topic because both sides are equally valid and points made on either side are both equally applicable.;negative
Now that said there are certain complications with implementing either idea.;neutral
Implementing gun control of course reduces the availability of deadly firearms to those who could possibly do harm.;negative
However illegal drugs are of course illegal and yet they are still produced and imported enmasse into America from its borders so its safe to say that a ban on domestic guns will just increase the demand for illegal firearms to be imported so criminals can still get them with relative ease.;negative
However without gun control, domestic guns become easier to ascertain but there are more civilians armed in any given area.;neutral
For instance a gunman enters a mall and opens fire on the people inside.;neutral
In an ordinary shopping mall numerous people will have a concealed firearm on there person at any given time.;negative
Now imagine that mall security is being held up by fleeing people that leaves those with concealed weapons to neutralize the threat.;negative
Guns are good for some and bad for others.;neutral
I think we need to look into the weapons used in shootings and see if they are stolen or bought with a license.;neutral
Most likely they are obtained illegally meaning that no matter what regulations you put in place those with bad intentions will still obtain firearms.;negative
that being said, our best hope for preventing more tragedy is arming those good citizens to act like a hidden police force to hopefully neutralize threats before they can cause considerable harm.;negative
Then of course arises the concern of laws like Stand Your Ground.;neutral
"Armed people killing innocents because they feel ""threatened"".";negative
A perfect solution is probably not obtainable but I think removing ALL firearms is a bad idea.;negative
Tighter regulations I do agree with but not the complete ban of firearms.;negative
If the point is saving lives, we should focus on the real dangers, like swimming pools.;negative
Pools are significantly more dangerous in the home than a gun is.;positive
What about the most dangerous machine in history?;neutral
The automobile.;neutral
We should make cars safer.;negative
Once we have tackled the big issues like cars and swimming pools, then we can start to think about the little (though seemingly more scary) problems.;negative
Like mass shootings.;neutral
"I am 100% against gun control but that's because life is too short to post on the losing side ;)";neutral
I like shooting people in the face, so dont take my guns I am an American and I breed with my siblings and I am erectable and I gimmie guns now.;negative
First off for the very obvious.;neutral
This is our right.;positive
Nobody can take away our rights.;positive
Now for the more complicated aspects.;neutral
Cities in America where gun control is the strongest have the most gun killing because a criminal is a criminal and doesn't care for the law.;negative
Also when a criminal know that nobody can defend themselves against a gun they are going to feel that they can attack and get away with it.;negative
Where I live it takes twenty to thirty minutes for a police officer to come out here.;negative
In those twenty minutes a lot can happen especially since both my parents work and me and my sister stay him alone a lot.;positive
My house has been a target for many years and we know that.;neutral
That's why when I was twelve I was taken out not only to learn what a gun can do but how to use one.;negative
I now am a sharp shooter but the guns aren't where I can get them easily.;negative
If I were attacked while my parents were gone I would release my dogs after my attacker and bust the door into my parents bedroom where I would find the guns.;negative
All of this would be done after I called the police but since it will take them twenty minutes a criminal would have a lot of time to act against me.;negative
I am seventeen now and I still know how to defend myself and have been the scary situation where someone tried to break on my house while I was alone.;negative
I was too young to understand guns because I hadn't been taught yet and let me tell you I was terrified.;negative
Older I feel more secure with a gun locked in my parents bedroom.;negative
Huns should be given out freely to the people so we can not only have our right but so we can protect ourselves.;negative
The door on my house is no longer locked for my protection but for yours.;negative
If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.;negative
Do I need to draw you a picture?;neutral
Wholly unregulated gun control is entirely illogical and inadvisable.;negative
As with any market product, particularly potentially dangerous ones, guns demand some degree of regulation.;negative
This debate should not be gun control versus no gun control, but a discussion of how much regulation is reasonable or ideal.;positive
Your use of negative words is very confusing.;negative
Which regulations do you like?;negative
Sorry?;neutral
If you point me to something more specific I can clarify.;neutral
Honestly, I think guns are largely a matter of secondary importance and receive more attention than they merit so I have not given great consideration to the details.;negative
I can say though that I support mandatory firearm safety training and licensing, as well as restrictions upon the availability of non-defensive and non-hunting firearms.;negative
What needs to change in America?;neutral
Cohesive financial security programs, narrowing income and class disparity, addressing poverty, improving education and access to education, addressing relationship and family violence, treatment and support facilities for addictions, appropriate physical and mental health care, infrastructure, etc.;negative
I could keep going, but I do think that gun violence is largely a consequence of other problems rather than a distinct problem in and of itself.;negative
So, why do we need gun control?;negative
Please continue advocating fixing the actual problem, like you just did.;negative
My opinion is that gun regulation is a secondary issue, but that does not mean we neglect it entirely.;negative
My stance is less nuanced on this issue than on others given my relative weighting of its importance, but I do still have an opinion on it.;negative
The argument against absolute deregulation seems apparent to me (correct me if I am wrong).;negative
With respect to the particular regulations I would support - training, licensing, and non-defensive/non-hunting firearm prohibitions - I consider the benefits of restriction to outweigh the harms.;negative
We require training and licensing for the possession and/or use of other potentially dangerous or deadly objects (e.g. cars and driving, chemical handling, etc.), and that we should want to know who possesses a firearm and be relatively confident that they possess the knowledge of how to wield it responsibly makes sense to me.;negative
Regarding non-defensive/non-hunting firearms, I see no compelling reason why anyone needs guns outside of those uses and the risks of allowing ownership outweigh the obscure potential benefits (albeit that the risks are, as already mentioned, a secondary problem to the root causes that generate them to begin with).;negative
Does this clarify adequately?;neutral
Obviously, but this is about gun confiscation actually, which I should have stated I guess but uh yeah...;negative
Anyways, the only regulations there should be is a background check and a safety course.;negative
And a psychological screening somehow maybe.;positive
Yes, you probably should have.;negative
Confiscation similarly has logical applications and is not a clear cut either-or question, in my opinion.;negative
Background checks, safety course, and stricter restrictions upon non-defensive and non-hunting firearms.;negative
Psych screening I oppose because it is ineffectual and problematic independent of the gun issue.;negative
Furthermore, restricting the rights of individuals because they have a diagnosable condition rather than because they have done anything seems wrong to me.;negative
Additionally, those with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators (and are more likely to be victims than those without mental illness).;negative
The psych screening they would look for is what Delta Force look for in military snipers, and they are 2 things to determine if you qualify or not, but only 1 of them applies to civilian issues.;negative
When Delta Force selects their snipers, they look for two things to avoid.;negative
"One is called the ""Texas Tower Syndrome"" referencing charles whitmans massacre of 14 people.";negative
This characteristic manifests itself when a person starts shooting and can't stop because it feels so good, such a sense of power, that he can't turn it off once his target is eliminated and will continue to shoot anyone in sight.;negative
The second thing they avoid is an emotional attachment to the target.;negative
But that is not important when we are talking about a citizen defending themselves.;negative
So we should look for the TTS in people, and this can be screenede easily by going to the firing range and seeing who empties their clip the fastest.;negative
Is there any evidence that this is actually an accurate and effective predictor for behavior in screening?;neutral
Even if it is, I suspect that the process for identifying TTS is more complex than simply booting out whoever empties their clip fastest.;negative
To accurately screen on a psych basis you would need someone trained in psychology, and limited resources make it likely that in implementation the screening conductor would be improperly prepared to make their assessment.;negative
Further, while eagerness and enjoyment of discharging a firearm may be one potential warning sign it is not uniformly the case that those exhibiting it would abuse their firearm right.;negative
It is also true that those predisposed to abuse that right may exhibit no warning signs whatsoever, either because the signs are missed or because they are not evidenced at the time of acquisition.;negative
Again, you will deny equal rights to individuals on what seems to me a vague and inaccurate basis.;negative
May I presume since you failed to respond to my other points you either agree or don't care enough to dispute them?;negative
I don't know, I got it from the book Inside Delta Force written by Eric L. Haney;neutral
If you don't think its a true story............;neutral
It is not even that I think the story is untrue, I just doubt that it would be effective as a screening measure (particularly in the context of gun regulation).;negative
Yeah they would have to see the people over weeks and weeks at a time and it just wouldn't work...;negative
Oh, and yea, you were right...;positive
Actually, we need to get tougher on criminals who use guns.;negative
Actually, we need to address the root causes of crime and violence.;neutral
Gun policy is a secondary issue at best, and by extension deterrence is a largely ineffectual response.;positive
I mostly agree with you.;positive
However, the death penalty is not a deterrent.;neutral
Many crimes are committed by repeat offenders, including murder.;negative
If we get rid of murderers, the number of murders will drop.;negative
It's simple math.;positive
I never said the death penalty is a deterrent.;negative
Most repeat offenders are created by the prison industrial complex which exacerbates the individual and social conditions which lead to crime and violence.;negative
If we address our broken justice system and attend to the social issues that actually matter, the number of murders will actually drop.;positive
It is simple logic, but apparently most people find that difficult.;negative
If murderers get the death penalty, and I mean a swift one, the murder rate will also drop.;negative
That presumes that most murders are premeditated, which they are not.;neutral
Also, way to persistently ignore my actual point.;negative
I consider it ceded that social issues contribute to murder and that we should focus there instead.;negative
"I am done wasting my time here; anticipate no further reply.";negative
I would like to see more regulations simply due to the possibility of an attack on a school, mall, theater, etc.;negative
What regulations need to be added to prevent people from going into a school that has already legally been declared a gun free zone?;negative
Heavier punishments for crimes involving firearms.;negative
Increase the backround checks and intended usage of a firearm if purchased.;negative
Limited availability to the public.;neutral
Restrictions on certain weapons.;neutral
There are mostly likely many more possibile ways to add regulations.;negative
We have this.;neutral
Have this.;neutral
Can you elaborate on how you would limit it?;negative
Have it.;neutral
Which weapons don't you like?;negative
This probably won't work, but I guess it isn't a bad thing to add.;negative
Right.;neutral
They don't work though.;negative
There are many ways to regulate ice cream, that doesn't make it a good idea.;negative
How would you know?;neutral
You don't even know what the possible solution is.;negative
Is that how much of a bias you hold towards your own beliefs?;neutral
How much of a bias do you have toward your belief?;negative
You couldn't even address the actual arguments.;neutral
The regulations that have been tried have failed.;negative
Saying there are possible regulations is the stupidest reason to have regulations.;negative
Your stance was that since regulations are possible, we should add them.;neutral
Incorrect assumption over what I initially stated.;negative
Go reread what I posted.;neutral
I said I would like to see more regulations due to possible attacks on schools, malls, theaters, etc.;negative
I address my own argument.;positive
It's you who hasn't directly assessed mine.;neutral
I am the only one who has addressed any of the arguments.;negative
We have the regulations you want and there are still shootings.;negative
You have no idea how to fix the problem.;negative
"Thats why I said ""I would like to see more regulations.";negative
There may be plans we dont know of yet.;negative
Well, that's awesome.;negative
I think giving me a million dollars will help stop gun violence.;negative
Let's try that too.;neutral
Cool.;positive
Explain how the acquisition of this money will help stop gun violence?;negative
I will wait if necessary.;neutral
Oh, you get to say unnamed regulations will magically solve the problem without stating which regulations or how they will stop anything, and my argument is bad?;negative
If you give me a million bucks I will pay 100 people $100 not to shoot anyone.;negative
Surely someone would have shot someone and I will have prevented it.;negative
Boom, gun violence reduced.;negative
And, I get some profit.;negative
No.;neutral
You aren't understanding.;negative
There may be regulations we have yet to think of that can limit gun violence.;negative
That's it.;neutral
That's all I'm saying.;neutral
Nothing else.;negative
If your method truly works then congratulations.;neutral
You found a method.;neutral
Now brainstorm and come up with more.;positive
Let's start with my first one and give me the million.;neutral
Then I can do more brainstorming.;neutral
Why should a mass shooter care when half the time he's going to off himself any way?;negative
background checks are fair.;neutral
asking what the intended usage is would be be unnecessarily invasive, unless you are going to strap every gun buyer into a lie detector... Then it would become considerably less worthless, but insanely invasive.;negative
"What part of ""shall not be infringed"" don't you understand?";negative
Agreed, but all valid restrictions are already there.;negative
A VA Tech shooting with a belt-fed automatic machine gun would result in hundreds of deaths, and there is no practical civilian use for such a weapon.;negative
They are incredibly hard to get legally and rightfully so.;negative
That doesn't make them good ideas.;negative
"What part of ""my daughter died because some man shot her at the movies"" don't you understand?";neutral
Doesn't make them bad either.;negative
It's unknown.;neutral
You never know what they would do.;neutral
91% of guns used in crimes are illegally owned in the first place.;negative
Criminals don't give a damn about your regulations.;negative
They will get weapons and they will use them the way they want.;neutral
My legally owned firearms have nothing to do with anyone getting killed.;negative
Way to cherry pick what yo respond to.;neutral
Yes, primarily from those who obtained the gun through legal means.;neutral
The guns is usually jot in their ownership.;neutral
Criminals have a mind.;neutral
A 0.01% reduction is still progress.;negative
How do these criminals obtain these guns anyway?;neutral
That's something to research so that outlet may be destroyed.;negative
What I didn't respond to I agreed.;neutral
Sorry I didn't make that clear.;negative
If you could press a magic button and make all guns disappear... yeah... maybe I would be for it.;negative
But you can't.;neutral
If you banned guns, law abiding citizens would lose theirs first.;negative
Do criminals sometimes get their guns from the legal market through theft or other means?;neutral
Yeah sure.;positive
If they didn't have that source they could always bring them into the country the same way illegal drugs come in.;neutral
In the end, criminals have guns and law abiding citizens don't.;negative
This is why we investigate the source of the illegal arms.;negative
Where do criminals obtain them?;neutral
That is the key to solving part of the process.;neutral
You are also using a slipper slope fallacy assuming A will logically lead to Z without any other hard evidence.;negative
I would suggest sticking to smaller claims.;neutral
We already do investigate the source of illegal arms... especially since they are responsible for 90% of the gun crimes.;negative
So what is your problem?;neutral
We are incapable of both having a free society and keeping every illegal substance and item out of the country.;negative
It is a fact of life.;positive
It is my opinion that we should give all law abiding citizens to tools to defend themselves in any situation.;negative
Criminals should have fear of facing a citizen with a concealed weapon every time they try to commit a violent crime.;negative
You may comfortable with trying to call 911 and waiting for someone else to show up with a gun to help you.;neutral
I chose to embrace our history in the US that idealizes self sufficiency and independence.;negative
If someone breaks into my home, even with a 1% chance of intent to harm my family, the only call I will be making is for someone to come pick up his dead corpse.;negative
I'm not completely against guns.;negative
I would just like to find a method to reduce the frequency of attacks on suseptible places.;negative
That's all.;neutral
I agree with what you are saying.;positive
I think your focus then should be mental health availability and procedures.;negative
Adam Lanza should not have been out in public.;negative
Someone should have certainly told his mother it is a bad idea to go shooting with him and she shouldn't keep guns around him.;negative
The new age response for dangerous people is to give them medication and let them go out into the world hoping they take it and hoping it is effective.;positive
But most importantly Adam Lanza should have had a father in the house in his teenage years.;negative
I don't know if anyone has researched what percentage of shooters grow up without their father, or in otherwise broken homes.;negative
But I would be willing to bet it is at least twice as prevalent as everyone else.;negative
Want to stop mass shootings?;neutral
Hop on board the conservative train to try to reinforce marriage and the family.;negative
That's the point.;neutral
Criminals don't obey the law.;negative
That's why we need swift punishment that fits the crime.;negative
A life for a life.;positive
Makes perfect sense to me.;positive
How many murders, and other violent crimes, are committed by repeat offenders?;negative
Remove them from the gene pool.;neutral
Problem solved.;neutral
The problem is how do we stop school shootings.;negative
The school shooters have all been first time offenders.;neutral
gun control is not anti-gun..................................................................;negative
If you are for gun control, you need to rethink your life;neutral
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that a ""great debater"" wouldn't assume that, because someone disagrees them on gun policy, that they must rethink their life.";negative
You know nothing at all about virtually everyone who does (or doesn't for that matter) support some degree of gun control.;negative
Your use of negative words is very confusing.;negative
Which regulations do you like?;negative
I think the guy in the red jacket is totally fake.;negative
it is extremely logical for criminals to want to have guns illegal;negative
you are not making logical sense here, put your feet in the shoes of the criminal, do you want other people to have guns?;negative
no you really dont;negative
and he didnt even say killing, he said home invasions.;negative
the point that he made still stands;neutral
criminals do not want other citizens to have guns, its as simple as that you cant argue against it;negative
i dont think you understand the street life very well.;positive
Yes, criminals don't want the general population armed.;negative
I am not saying otherwise.;negative
You actually said the exact opposite;neutral
didn't say that criminals wouldn't be happy that they would be charged with less crimes if caught, I just said that it is bad to put a fake criminal in a video.;negative
So then maybe he wasnt fake, me and you do not know, criminals usually have a huge ego, right?;negative
so maybe he was priding himself about what he does;neutral
i can see how putting a fake criminal advocating for gun control is weird, but if you were to ask any criminal/thug on the street are you for gun control/regulation i assure you they will say most definitely yes.;negative
If i stick up a law abiding citizen in a world where guns are tightly controlled and there are no conceal carrry laws, then i know almost for a fact he will not pull a gun on me, and i will be the one with the gun.;negative
Why do you think gun free zones are the biggest targets for shootings?;negative
Because there is noone there to stop them;neutral
That doesn't mean they didn't have a fake person speaking.;negative
An unregulated gun economy;neutral
"So saying "" Let's stick to stuff that actually happens.""";negative
is utterly foolish.;negative
These things ACTUALLY happen.;neutral
Please, fucking read.;neutral
"I purposefully said ""MAY lead"" as in it's probable.";positive
There are obviously more ways to get guns then there were back in the 1950's and such.;negative
Yes, stress causes violence, I agree, but a gun is an outlet for anger.;negative
Just because you have an idea doesn't make it probable.;negative
Doesn't help your argument at all.;negative
There is still no reason to believe the gun is an outlet for anger.;negative
Violence was the outlet for anger.;negative
It already happen twit.;neutral
I just said that.;neutral
Why the fuck did you leave that out?;negative
That was the purpose of the articles.;neutral
What the fuck?;neutral
Did you read any of the articles?;neutral
Shooting somebody is violent.;negative
They shot their victims out of ANGER.;neutral
Clarify yourself.;neutral
You can't justify your use of the word probable.;negative
Make sense now?;neutral
It doesn't matter what tool was used to commit the violence.;neutral
You have a link to violence only.;neutral
You shouldn't make conclusions about guns because of those articles.;negative
What does this have to do with guns being an outlet for anger.;neutral
I have linked GUN VIOLENCE with anger.;negative
I have proved that guns serve as an outlet of anger.;negative
That's all that was required of me to do.;negative
Why are you trying to make new claims that have no ground?;negative
If I get mad and shoot someone should I just ignore that fact that I used a gun?;negative
I choose the gun.;neutral
Why?;negative
That's what we wish to know.;neutral
Why the gun?;neutral
Is it quicker?;neutral
More intimidating?;negative
What?;neutral
It completely relevant to my argument.;positive
Your job is to disprove my notion that guns serve as an outlet of anger which you have yet to do.;negative
You said something will probably happen.;neutral
You don't know that.;neutral
No, you linked someone who happened to use a gun.;neutral
No, you have only proven anger in general.;neutral
Not if you want to extrapolate and take away other peoples rights.;negative
Since when are you against making claims that have no ground?;neutral
";)";neutral
Why is shooting someone magically a whole different type of violence?;negative
Your argument doesn't even support your case.;negative
If someone just chose a gun because it was convenient, that means they want to commit violence, not gun violence.;negative
You haven't demonstrated that it was the gun that was the outlet.;negative
You have demonstrated anger was an outlet.;neutral
It already did.;neutral
Why the fuck can you not realize that?;negative
Okay you're just a fucking twit.;negative
They were angry.;negative
They used a damn gun as an outlet of their anger.;negative
Why the fuck can you not realize that?;negative
No, I have given you evidence showing that guns can serve as an outlet for anger.;neutral
They clearly did in the articles.;neutral
This isn't even what I'm talking about.;negative
My only claim is that guns can serve as an outlet for anger.;negative
That's it.;neutral
They do.;neutral
Case closed.;neutral
I see.;positive
I have given you evidence of which you have yet to prove incorrect.;neutral
I have given you a notion you keep trying to dodge and you are saying I have no ground?;negative
You're thay damn headstrong abiut debating that you become ignorant.;negative
Wtf?;neutral
If I want to call people names on the internet am I cyber bullying or just bullying?;negative
No.;neutral
Anger was an outlet to what?;neutral
The emotional response will trigger the physical response in this situation.;positive
You're a dumbass.;neutral
If I become sad my outlet for my sadness may be writting down things in a journal.;negative
Guns may serve as an outlet for anger?;negative
How so?;neutral
When someone is mad they may grab a gun and shoot someone.;negative
When has this ever occured?;neutral
Plenty of times (this is the place for the article to show that some angry people will go grab a gun and shoot someone).;negative
What is your rebuttal?;neutral
They used violence.;neutral
Why don't people just fire into the air?;negative
If guns were the actual outlet things would be better.;neutral
People would drive to their gun range and fire until the anger went away;neutral
You have presented a story where someone needed to hurt someone because of their anger, not that they needed to shoot someone.;negative
I did prove incorrect.;neutral
If you call people names on the internet are you trying to be mean or are you specifically trying to make the internet mean?;negative
Sorry, I meant to use the word violence, not anger.;negative
Do you do pen journaling or pencil.;neutral
If you are right, that should matter.;positive
You have not demonstrated any reason why there should be special rules for different types of violence;negative
Okay?;neutral
Does that mean it didn't happen?;neutral
No.;neutral
Does this prove that guns aren't an outlet of anger?;negative
They used a gun.;neutral
"I haven't heart a criminal admit to killing someone with ""violence"".";negative
They will usually explain what they killed them with.;neutral
This still doesn't prove that guns aren't an outlet for anger.;negative
I'd love to know.;positive
"So a hoodlum will actually spend time driving to a firing range when the people around him will mostly likely be telling him to ""cap his ass""?";negative
No.;neutral
Prove this claim of yours.;neutral
That doesn't even make sense.;negative
Answer my question.;neutral
That makes more sense, but clarity in violence is key to determining how the victim was killed or harmed.;neutral
"This is why there is a term called ""gun violence"".";negative
What?;neutral
What does it matter?;neutral
Did you even understand the allusion?;negative
What rules?;neutral
I have classified types of violence.;neutral
I have not compared different types of injury at all.;negative
I never said one was worse than the other.;negative
It means you didn't prove anything.;neutral
A gun being used doesn't prove anything.;negative
You still have the burden of proof.;neutral
We put people on trial for murder, not murder with gun, murder with knife, murder with fists.;negative
Because guns aren't an outlet for anger.;neutral
None of your examples had hoodlums in it.;negative
Hoodlums aren't doing it out of anger.;negative
I answered with a question.;neutral
Cyber bullying is done to be a bully, not to make the internet a bad place.;negative
You act as if guns are used to make guns look bad.;negative
The term gun violence is usually used in a very stupid way.;negative
Why doesn't it matter what instrument you use to write your journal, but it matters what instrument you use to commit violence?;negative
Then why make the special case of banning guns?;neutral
How many time must I tell you that all I am saying is that guns serve as an outlet for anger?;negative
Can you please stick to that?;positive
Otherwise I'm out.;negative
I'm not saying limit the population on anything.;negative
Thay is a separate debate.;neutral
I feel that if you want to own a gun that person should undergo a series of psychological exams, I mean we require those test for people to get a drivers license, both physical and mental but why not guns?;negative
Another thing is make it law that every gun in American needs to have a GPS tracking chip;negative
if he was a known criminal;neutral
The man had another accomplice with him, don't you think two men, probably fucked up on drugs, if they saw a defenseless woman standing there, don't you think something like, oh idk, rape might happen?;negative
And you obviously aren't familiar with the great law of america that if anyone enters your property without permission, you are free to do what you choose to this invasion of your security.;negative
He would be a REALLY shitty criminal if cops knew who he was.;negative
And its hard to identify people with hoods on, hats, glasses, etc..;negative
.;neutral
If you are not from america then there is no way you can possibly fathom the amount of corruption and crime that runs rampant in our politics/corporations;negative
I am familiar with your laws.;neutral
It is barbaric.;neutral
This doesnt justify the public being permitted to hand out the death sentence to each other.;negative
The basis of the law of self defence should be that you can use reasonable force equal to the threat your under.;positive
USA is on the same level as Africa and some Latin American countries.;neutral
Honestly, I think guns are largely a matter of secondary importance and receive more attention than they merit so I have not given great consideration to the details.;negative
I can say though that I support mandatory firearm safety training and licensing, as well as restrictions upon the availability of non-defensive and non-hunting firearms.;negative
Heavier punishments for crimes involving firearms.;negative
Limited availability to the public.;neutral
Restrictions on certain weapons.;neutral
Increase the backround checks and intended usage of a firearm if purchased.;negative
There are mostly likely many more possibile ways to add regulations.;negative
Right.;neutral
They don't work though;neutral
Heavier punishments for crimes involving firearms.;negative
Increase the backround checks and intended usage of a firearm if purchased.;negative
Limited availability to the public.;neutral
Restrictions on certain weapons.;neutral
There are mostly likely many more possibile ways to add regulations.;negative
"What part of ""shall not be infringed"" don't you understand?";negative
That doesn't make them good ideas.;negative
It is getting very scary out there.;neutral
Crazy people with guns.;neutral
Not a good combo.;neutral
well the 2nd amendment was meant for protection, being as if your house was getting robbed and you had a gun for protection.;negative
but now, people are carrying them around in their pockets.;neutral
and just shooting random people for no reason.;negative
The wording is clearly, clearly intended for State militias.;negative
A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.;positive
"Gun people want so bad for ""people"" to refer to everyone, but it refers to those ""people"" who are part of a militia.";negative
Now, you'll never convince gun people to give up their guns, it's like a religion almost to many of them, so fine.;positive
But there needs to be serious gun control.;negative
Both of the recent shootings were crazy people who got guns legally.;neutral
Most crimes are commited with guns obtained legally.;negative
Gun sellers want to sell more guns, you're not going to get them to self-regulate so long as there is no serious penalty when they sell a nut job a gun, so harsher regulations need to be passed to ensure genuine effort is put into keeping guns out of the hands of crazy people, and real penalties have to be enforced when they fail.;negative
Whether this is up to the federal government, the State, whether there are things put in place that encourages them to better self-regulate is a great debate, but something should be changed I believe.;negative
Sane people will still be able to get guns if they want, it might take a little longer, they might have to jump through more hoops, but they'll get their gun.;positive
Gun sellers will still make ridiculous amounts of money.;negative
They'll have to spend more on background checks and other means of determining whether someone should have a gun, they'll sell a few less guns, but they'll still be filthy rich.;positive
This is a good compromise I believe.;positive
"Okay gun nuts, on with the downvotes and juvenile insults about my ""Unamerican-ness"" starting... NOW!";negative
I suppose you don't know anything about Constitutional history.;neutral
James Madison's original wording of the Second Amendment when he first proposed it (it took a few times to finally get it passed, and stuff got switched around):;negative
"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.";negative
The main issue was on Congress determining religiously scrupulous personnel, and that part, after much debate, was eventually taken out.;negative
As well, the Supreme Court has repeatedly decided that the Second Amendment DOES protect an individual's right to keep and bear arms.;positive
"And ""the people"" in the Constitution has always meant individuals.";positive
The well-regulated militia is a separate clause from the RIGHT of the people to keep and bear arms.;negative
Areas with the highest gun control laws have the most shootings, incase you haven't noticed yet criminals don't follow the laws, thats kind of their defining feature.;negative
"Secondly, I don't exactly like being disarmed by an oppressive government under the osmosis of ""keeping me safe.""";negative
That's hardly strong proof for 'more gun control = more shooting', I'd imagine that the laws follow the shootings, rather than the other way round.;negative
Especially when you look at the issue in a global sense, and compare countries with lots of gun control, to those without (the US), the argument seems to go the other way.;negative
Its not, just proof that they don't go away and your essentially disarming those who aren't using the guns irresponsibly.;neutral
These countries still have violence and mass killings, except they'll use different forms of weapons and it will be alot harder for you to get a gun.;negative
It shows that some gun control laws don't always reduce gun crime immediately.;negative
I'll agree to that.;positive
There are many reasons why this could happen - the lack of conclusive data makes it difficult to come to any real conclusions.;negative
However, I haven't researched gun control laws in various states too much, so I won't speak with any real authority on state policies.;neutral
I disagree (if you're implying it's just as prevalent).;negative
There are many more homicides in the United States than Europe, in general (there are also many more more murders: 1.28 in UK - often claimed to be the most violent country in Europe - to over 4 in the US).;negative
While violent crime as a whole is still widespread, I hardly think taking guns out of the hands of criminals is a bad thing.;negative
Well, it does vary from state to state (and country to country) which makes the situation more messy, obviously you can buy a gun off the black market, but if a less regulated state or country is near by you could just go there.;negative
Violence isn't as prevalent, but guns aren't the main cause of death and killings, if you multiplied the number of deaths from guns by 10 poor diet and lack of exercise would still kill more people, not to say fast food causes violence but not as many people die from gun violence as you may think.;negative
Most of the guns you'll be taking are from people just using their right to bear arms and defend themselves, not criminals.;negative
P.S. James Holmes had no previous record (so I've heard), which means that trying to regulate only giving guns to sane people is absurd.;negative
I'm sorry, are you under the impression that a criminal record is the only way to tell if someone is seeing a psychiatrist, exhibiting reclusive and delusional behavior, whilst stockpiling weapons?;negative
If someone is looking to buy apocolypse levels of ammo, an array of guns, and body armor all within a short time span, is there some inherent reason gun sellers cannot look further into it?;negative
It would have been a simple thing to keep guns out of this crazy bastards hands.;negative
And the most recent sikh temple shooting, that guy was on an FBI watch list.;negative
You don't think someone who is a member of a hate group and on an FBI watch list should be denied a gun initially on those grounds?;negative
Had the question been framed differently, I probably would have come down on the side of this argument.;negative
Keep guns out of public hands?;negative
By the wording, I would assume that it means all guns whatsoever.;negative
I simply don't agree with that.;negative
I do believe that we all have the right/responsibility of protecting ourselves, our families, our homes.;neutral
The tool of a handgun and/or rifle is most efficient in these situations.;positive
Having said that, I certainly believe there's a lot of room for common sense within our legislation.;negative
"The adage ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people"" is one of the most asinine expressions in the world in my view.";negative
Well, of course, people kill people, but Guns take the efficiency of the task to a WHOLE OTHER FUCKING LEVEL.;negative
How would you feel to learn that your neighbor, John, has an atomic bomb in his basement.;negative
Well, you say that's different.;neutral
First, a bomb is not a gun and you can kill a lot more people very quickly with it.;negative
Just one little slip up and it's all over.;neutral
The stakes are all of the sudden a lot higher.;positive
But isn't that one we're arguing really?;negative
Weapons of warfare versus something to shoot a deer with?;negative
We're talking design and intent here.;negative
Surely, we can see the clear difference.;positive
We need to see the difference.;negative
Crazy people are going to get weapons whether they're legal or not.;negative
Keeping guns away from everyone else will only cause more harm.;negative
This is one of the fundamental differences between liberals and conservatives.;neutral
Liberals believe that even though criminals are criminals, we can still pass laws and make them abide by them... meaning that they believe that if we pass laws, criminals are going to be restricted and not be able to do as much and, therefore, not be able to do crimes as easily.;negative
Yes, they won't be able to do crimes as easily but they are still criminals!;positive
Conservatives understand that criminals are criminals and that regardless of what laws we pass, they are still going to commit crimes!;positive
Regardless of whether we pass gun control laws, there are still ways to illegally obtain some.;negative
The shootings that have provoked these discussions were both pre-planned, showing that regardless of whether the person was able to obtain a legal gun or not, he would still have gotten one illegally if it came down to it...;negative
Imagine a world where only criminals had guns....;neutral
Imagine a place where a man could not protect his own family... Imagine a place were only the strong survived... Imagine a place called liberal America...;negative
Areas with the highest gun control laws have the most shootings, incase you haven't noticed yet criminals don't follow the laws, thats kind of their defining feature.;negative
That's hardly strong proof for 'more gun control = more shooting';negative
compare countries with lots of gun control, to those without (the US), the argument seems to go the other way.;negative
Its not, just proof that they don't go away and your essentially disarming those who aren't using the guns irresponsibly.;neutral
These countries still have violence and mass killings, except they'll use different forms of weapons and it will be alot harder for you to get a gun.;negative
However, I haven't researched gun control laws in various states too much, so I won't speak with any real authority on state policies.;neutral
I disagree (if you're implying it's just as prevalent).;negative
While violent crime as a whole is still widespread, I hardly think taking guns out of the hands of criminals is a bad thing.;negative
Should guns be completely banned or not?;negative
There are alot f reasons why guns should only have restrictions put on them instead of being completely banned, along with lots of negative affects of bnning them.;negative
There are also multiple other ways to have a good compromise in the eyes of pro and con gun ban people.;positive
Guns being banned will hurt a very large percentage of safe and responsible gun owners whose guns are a large part of their lives.;negative
Murder being banned hurts serial killers.;negative
Does this justify the ban being abolished?;negative
That is a mute point.;positive
It is very idiotic for you to think of such bull$hit.;negative
There are so many gun in the US already banning them would only effect law obeying people.;negative
Mass murders use the black market to get their guns idiot.;negative
1) Learn to spell moot.;neutral
2) I reported your comment for abuse.;negative
3) GTFO this site.;neutral
Removing guns from house hold is the worse thing you can do.;negative
Let me tell you exactly why as a Information Security Engineer (info sec / IT sec ).;negative
1) Law abiding citizen will obey the law.;neutral
Regardless if you want guns or not, criminals have ways to find one and kill you.;negative
2) Guns equalize the situation where cops will take 5 minutes minimum to bring some body bags to your house.;negative
You either want to use that body bag or you don't.;negative
3) Guns in America was not meant for hunting as a primary purpose.;negative
It is your second amendment right / duty to have one as our founding fathers have seen how government abuses its power to fellow citizens.;positive
Government should serve people, not the other way around.;negative
4) People kill people , not tools kill people.;negative
You say all you want that these equipment make it easier for bad people to do harmful things.;negative
However, would you also want to get rid of chances for law abiding citizen to defense themselves.;neutral
If you say the cops can do it then you are delusional.;negative
They don't have the jurisdiction to even search you or run to your house to do things on your property.;negative
Go find out about the law.;neutral
5) Countries that have extremely strict gun laws don't really work well either.;negative
Japan still has high crime rates, they just hide their news.;negative
People still kill each other in many different ways.;neutral
6) I do agree with fully automatic weapons can be ridiculous since you cannot hit anything accurately and should just spread the harm.;negative
However, having a regular semi-automatic firearms should not be excluded in any state or the country.;neutral
I suggest you go learn about firearms really well before you say stuff.;neutral
7) Law enforcement do agree that black rifles do not create crimes.;negative
Crimes were made by people who can't afford to have anything.;neutral
They purchased cheap crappy firearms in black market anyway.;negative
All can all.;neutral
I know that the bad guys will go to your house not mine for sure.;negative
Why?;negative
Because I am ready to defend myself and my family for the right of life and freedom of speech.;positive
Do you like Commie countries?;neutral
You can go to China and see how that feels.;neutral
Educate your children about firearms and proper manner in society is the key.;negative
Firearms are not the problem.;negative
US government themselves deals more than any other agencies in the world.;neutral
Go figure!;neutral
Very good points...;positive
1) It will be harder for criminals to find and they could get caught... If a criminal finds it people can be in danger because they could die before the police come... they could maybe transport guns?;negative
but i think that could be caught and MORE bad people will be put in jail because the person who transported it is not to give guns.;negative
WITH and WITHOUT guns the chance of getting killed is not much... If you are in open i doubt you would have a gun... If you are at home where there's burglary they don't often use guns... in the UK we don't see burglaries with guns often but i did hear quite a while ago someone on a gun rampage in Legoland...;negative
2) Police can be very quick they are just somewhere around the area... Usually the police arrive before someone gets killed.;negative
3) If you get a gun license you could easily go outside and kill a bunch of people....;negative
very very easily;positive
4) People can kill people if they do not have tools.;neutral
We cant control people!;negative
we can just arrest them but then people keep doing it!;neutral
5) The ways to kill people are limited to crime rates get lower... and Japan is a big place I think they might need guns or something... it kind of depends a bit.;neutral
6) Learn about firearms really well then get a gun!;positive
7) Crimes leads to more Crimes... We need to reduce the chances of crimes Compare USA with UK and see the diffrence... UK is safer.;negative
I think to get a gun you must know a lot about them and firearms and those sorts of things... I think military should be only to use it maybe some very experienced if there is some which i think there is.;negative
.;neutral
Then how come there are dead people?;neutral
Why don't we see that?;negative
The mass shootings that are popularized in the news are very rare compared to the number of guns out there.;positive
How is UK safer?;neutral
You haven't provided any information.;neutral
They have more crime.;neutral
Yes, all America needs is ANOTHER preventable black market.;negative
I mean, the war on drugs was so effective.;negative
Prohibition was sweet.;positive
The War on crime in the 20s really calmed shit down.;negative
I think we are going to have to face the fact that cracking down on distribution in the regulated white market is not the answer.;negative
A lot of people bring up countries like Sweden or England who have strict gun control, but they also have great education, mental health options, and other social systems that make it so that there is always a better option then guns.;positive
Very good points...;positive
Guns could be causing all of this!;neutral
we need to stop everything which is bad to control society!;negative
I don't know if your brain was on vacation, but I'll spell it out.;negative
Guns are not the cause.;negative
They are the effect.;neutral
Actually the American gun problems only spring up in times of strict rises in control.;negative
During the time of illegal land seizures by the government we had road gangs pop up, not because there where guns, but because they had no choice.;negative
During the war on drugs more gangs armed themselves and our gun violence rates spiked above the Prohibition era.;negative
Why?;negative
Because we forced a large grey market into the ultra competitive black market.;neutral
Speaking of prohibition See War on drugs.;negative
You'll get the idea.;neutral
.;neutral
So our regular gun violence follows a predictable pattern.;negative
Make a black market, gun violence goes up.;neutral
As for the more unstable elements of society...well if your going to gun down a school full of children and kill yourself having a legal gun is not a big deal.;negative
And they are not hard to get despite what popular fiction might say.;negative
A weapon is a tool.;neutral
Technology is neutral.;neutral
Perhaps we should just have tougher licenses and tackle social problems that make people go crazy.;negative
I truly believe that the United States Government should legalize guns because guns dont kill people, people kill people also wild boars kill people.;negative
The US should invest in mental health instead of taking away guns.;negative
The mental health in the US is nowhere close the the mental health abilities as other countries.;negative
Banning guns is a awful idea!;negative
If more people carried guns we would all be safer because rapest and what not would not want to take a risk.;negative
Also you could shoot animals that attack you!;neutral
Guns make us much safer in conclution!;neutral
Disarmed People = Are Dominated People;neutral
Simple as that so do we really want to ban guns?;negative
If our military didn't have guns, they wouldn't be able to defend very much.;negative
Gun control never applies to military, your point is moot.;negative
UK and Germany are prime examples of how guns can truly be abolished from a nation.;positive
Crime is higher in the UK, gun control clearly doesn't fix everything;negative
"It is not quite ""Clear"" as well... you have not provided any information.";negative
Unfortunately neither have you, and I haven't seen anyone else provide anything either.;negative
I did a search for crime in England and the only thing I saw was that the crime rate is higher.;negative
Where is your information?;neutral
"""Everything"" was never what gun control sought to solve and it never will be.";negative
Crime per capita, because per population more of it is centered in urban areas.;negative
There is no other reason for this.;negative
And crime rate is not murder by gun rate.;negative
The U.S. has way way way way more of these.;neutral
That's the point.;neutral
So, if murder by gun is reduced but it makes the place less safe that is a good thing?;negative
I am just trying to figure out your position.;negative
How is less people dying less safe?;neutral
Do you equate a stolen wallet with murder?;neutral
Less guns did not lead to more crime in England anyway, it lead to less crime in England, and way less murder.;negative
Similarly better gun control has in the past and will again, lead to less crime in the U.S. and way less murder.;positive
That's how it works every single time.;positive
You've made a false comparison.;negative
"It's like if they took guns away from Ethiopian warlords and then there were less murders in Ethiopia but there were still more murders in Ethiopia than in the U.S. so you say ""see!";negative
"we need warlords with more guns in the U.S. because after they took the guns away from warlords in Ethiopia they still had more murders than the U.S.!!!""";neutral
While of course completely ignoring the point that murders actually decreased there.;negative
Which would be typical of an NRA newsletter, but try to be a little smarter than that yourself.;negative
So, you are clearly against guns for absolutely no reason.;negative
I am glad your true colors have shown.;negative
You are for banning guns no matter what.;neutral
I asked you if it was less safe to ban guns and you still think it is a good idea.;neutral
England's murder rate was not really affected by gun control.;negative
England has always had a lower murder rate than USA.;negative
They took away guns in England and the murder rate didn't change, but it is still less than USA, so you are the one who says look, getting rid of guns works.;negative
What about this Harvard study?;neutral
I stated the reasons.;neutral
I'm for gun control because smart gun control is proven to decrease gun deaths.;negative
That you need to pretend I've not said this half a dozen times does say something about either your lack of intelligence or your cultish worship of guns.;negative
Not sure which is worse.;negative
I'm for gun control, but the debate does not allow that distinction.;negative
This sentence makes no sense.;negative
If you mean that you incorrectly stated that banning guns makes people in general less safe, and that I replied you are incorrect and that it makes people safer and so is a good idea, then you are correct.;negative
Wrong;neutral
Due to better gun control laws, which is my point.;negative
Yes it did.;neutral
True.;neutral
Thanks to better gun control.;neutral
That is what I and statistics say, yes.;neutral
That's not a Harvard study, and the information in it has been debunked in every case.;negative
It does not take into account other issues which lead to crime and treats all gun ownership the same while utterly ignoring all regulation on those guns.;negative
Since my point is and has always been regulation, the skewed stats therein do not apply to any of the arguments I've made.;negative
Every statistic I have ever seen has supported my view or has been a lie, that is where I draw my conclusion from.;positive
I have read that England has always had a lower murder rate than USA even before they enacted their gun control.;neutral
I also read that England's overall murder rate was not affected by gun control.;neutral
"I couldn't find the information that you use to support your ""reasoning.""";negative
You grip to you belief that gun control works, and you're some sort of great person.;negative
But, I hold on to my belief that gun control doesn't work and I am some sort of jerk.;negative
It's unfortunate you only believe statistics published by NRA supporters instead of non-partisan entities then.;negative
Well, we know for a fact gun control works, and at the very least it is worth a try since there is no evidence it would not work.;negative
You though would rather more kids and innocent people die, you think owning a gun you will never need is worth more then their lives,;neutral
So yeah, gun nuts like your are assholes.;negative
No, you are the asshole :P;neutral
My statistics are better than yours, yours are stupid :P (I looked at stuff from BBC and the guardian, those damn American news agencies);negative
I have seen gun control not work (Chicago, Washington D.C.), but my view is different from yours so I must be wrong I guess.;negative
There is evidence for my side.;neutral
You don't care at all if people die.;negative
You only care because it is preventable.;negative
If we bring up anything else that kills people you find a way to trivialize those numbers.;negative
Sweet, you have nothing to say, I won the argument.;positive
It's too bad because I started to look up murder rates and it turns out England's murder rate only goes up while the US murder rate keeps going down.;negative
Good thing you didn't continue because your lack of facts was going to be your end.;negative
The reason for increased gun violence in Chicago and DC is the increase in poverty.;negative
It is a short trip to Indiana or Maryland to buy any gun one wants at a gun show, usually with no background check.;negative
Compared to times of similar poverty in cities when guns were better controlled, gun crimes are down.;negative
You can compare this to cities like Honolulu where there are no nearby cities where one can buy a gun.;negative
Gun crime consistently goes down when there is not access to guns.;negative
The point of controlling guns, what recent debate about, is not prohibition.;negative
It is accepted that people for whatever reason want guns.;negative
The debate is about the number of bullets and the power of the gun.;positive
When you limit this less people die.;neutral
That is a fact.;neutral
A school shooting by some nut will result in less deaths when they have less bullets and less powerful guns.;negative
This is a fact.;neutral
So there are two elements at play.;neutral
1.;neutral
A citizen with an automatic weapon designed for war zones is useless for hunting, self-defense, or anything accept playing around on a range.;negative
2.;neutral
These guns are used in mass shootings resulting in more deaths than would occur if these guns designed specifically for war were not available.;negative
The logical conclusion is to limit these guns and the size of the magazines.;negative
You still get a gun if it makes you feel better, so no need to cry, it's just limiting the size and power in order to save lives.;negative
All of these arguments against it are incredibly selfish and frankly tragic.;negative
It is a bunch of people (by a bunch I mean like 30%, 70% including even conservatives are for better gun control) falling for an NRA campaign whose only, only, only goal is to sell more guns.;negative
This at the cost of human life.;neutral
Your policy causes MORE people to die by any means.;negative
The facts are people die when guns are BANNED.;negative
Why do you want people to die?;negative
Reducing gun death is WORTHLESS if more people die overall.;negative
Hawaii and England are islands.;neutral
You can't ban guns in the USA with Mexico next door, or with all of the gun manufacturing going on in the country.;negative
You keep forming opinions from facts not in evidence.;neutral
It has been shown that MORE guns means less death and yet you find a way to think the exact opposite.;negative
I am sorry that I don't get my facts from the CCP like you do, but that doesn't mean I am wrong.;negative
Gun bans never in the history of the world have lead to more gun deaths.;negative
In every case where guns limited less people die from guns when comparisons are made on an equal socio-economic spectrum.;negative
You are dealing with an incorrect set of facts, or pulling shit out of your ass since you offer nothing to back up these claims.;neutral
I didn't say gun deaths would go up.;negative
This is why I am right and you are wrong.;negative
MURDER rates go UP when guns are banned.;negative
MORE people DIE if guns are banned.;neutral
You choose the side where MORE people DIE.;neutral
But, your whole argument is that you are saving lives.;positive
Why does it matter what was used to kill the person?;negative
Is a person more dead when killed with a gun than when killed with a knife?;neutral
If 23 people have to die for 30 people to live, isn't that a good trade off?;negative
If the socioeconomic spectrum is more important for determining that people will be more likely to die, how come we aren't focusing the effort to fix that problem?;negative
Taking away guns does not help the socioeconomic problems we have.;negative
Murder rates go down when guns are better regulated.;negative
What on earth do you believe would make murder rates go up?;neutral
The idea is ridiculous.;negative
That crazy idea you and other gun nuts have, that they are somehow safer with a gun, is false.;negative
Statistically, if you have a gun, you are more likely to accidentally shoot yourself than defend yourself.;negative
Guns are not protection, it's the fantasy of protection.;negative
So keep your silly fantasy if you want, whatever, but they should still be better regulated.;negative
You are the one with the fantasy.;positive
I totally understand your belief system.;positive
But, it is a complex system.;positive
You have completely ignored the fact that guns provide protection without having to be fired.;negative
All you do is wave your arms around and say that a world without guns can't possibly be more dangerous because of some gut feeling you have that isn't based on anything that has actually happened in the real world.;negative
I looked up the murder rates for America and for England.;neutral
America's murder keeps going down and it is the lowest since the 1960's.;neutral
England's murder rate tends to be going up even though they keep passing more and more restrictive gun control.;negative
How do you explain that trend if gun regulations actually reduce murder?;neutral
England's laws concerning guns have been virtually the same for decades.;negative
Recent rising crime, as stated, has to do with austerity measures which are making more poor people even poorer.;negative
These stats have nothing to do with gun control.;negative
The relevant numbers here are only when compared directly to the U.S. taking into account factors which increase crime.;neutral
As for the U.S., murder rates have been rising drastically in the last three years.;negative
In our case our economy has improved over this time, the opposite of England and Europe's economy.;positive
So the murder rate rising cannot correlate with economic depression in our case.;negative
See why you cannot make a direct comparison?;negative
In the last three years gun ownership has increased though, a lot.;negative
Other things which have increased include paranoia, distrust of government, and fear for future, disconnected from an improving economy.;negative
This mentality leads to more people who should not have guns seeking guns, and they then use those guns to kill people.;negative
This is a prime reason for the increased murder rate over the last three years.;negative
Better gun control makes it easier to keep guns out of the hands of crazy people.;positive
Limiting ammunition and the power of the gun means that when someone who is crazy does get a gun, they are able to kill less people.;positive
So you are saving lives two ways.;positive
Meanwhile, the sorts of criminals who are dissuaded from carrying out a criminal act due to the fear of guns are no more or less dissuaded whether the person has a hand gun with 6 bullets or an AK47.;negative
It is the same.;neutral
So limiting gun power and ammunition has no negative impact as far as protection.;negative
The only impact is on the crazies who then are able to kill fewer people less often.;negative
What about England's new gun regulation added in 1997, is that decades of the same gun regulation?;negative
In 1890 - 1892 England had 3 gun deaths, 1 per year and guns were not banned.;negative
They started gun regulation early 20th century and gun deaths have not been eliminated.;neutral
Every once in a while England adds more laws and murder goes UP immediately, then goes down but back to levels even or higher than where they were.;negative
England has a century of steady growth when it comes to murder rate, so it has nothing to do with their economy.;negative
America's murder rate has been going down, your CCP statistics are wrong.;negative
I hope you see the irony in the fact that people like you are the reason why gun sales have skyrocketed.;neutral
"Obama has been the #1 gun salesman for about 5 years now ;)";neutral
Crazy people killing people is a RARE event.;positive
Creating laws based on these mass shootings is insane because clinically crazy people are more likely to be victims.;negative
Assault rifles have killed less children in the last 5 years than hammers and clubs, how would banning them fix anything?;negative
There is no guarantee that hand guns won't be targeted by you anti gun nuts next, why should anyone give up their rights when you admit that assault rifles deter crime?;negative
Those changes were not major, guns have been strictly regulated for decades.;negative
Notice your numbers stop at 1992 (assuming 1892 is a typo).;negative
The new regulation in 1997 were enforced as a result of rising murders up to that point, after 1982.;negative
You'll notice a decrease I'll bet after 1997.;neutral
Your numbers are taking a snapshot of rates in the 80s and comparing them to the current condition, meanwhile in between there were rises and dips.;negative
The point is recent rises have to do with poverty.;neutral
You are trying, it seems, to make a connection in between gun regulation and an increase in gun deaths.;negative
Let's think about this though.;neutral
By this logic you are saying that defending against gun deaths by pulling out your six shooter Dirty Harry like is something that happens enough to be statistically relevant.;negative
This of course is a silly notion.;negative
We know that the cases of defending against murder via gun is rare because those driven to the point of murder are not thinking about consequence in that moment.;negative
It's a none issue.;negative
So let's focus on whether there are relevant numbers the other direction.;neutral
This I have to dispute.;neutral
Numbers in the last three years are up.;neutral
Those stats are pretty clear.;neutral
No, Fox and other far right wing sources are the #1 salesmen.;negative
They have created a strawman and have tricked people into fearing their rights are being taken.;negative
This has turned into something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, true.;positive
Hate groups and militant groups are at an all time high thanks to this strawman, these unhinged people account for much of the gun violence, and the increase in gun violence has lead to something like 70% of people, democrat and republican, now supporting better regulation of guns.;negative
The irony is the fear spread of something which did not exist has convinced many that the thing which did not exist should, better regulation of guns.;negative
True, but it happens yes?;neutral
Victims in many ways, I agree.;negative
But not victims of random shootings I'd say.;neutral
So do you believe that in answer to their victimization we should supply crazy people with guns?;neutral
You know, to protect themselves?;neutral
"Regulation of guns is no ""nuttier"" than regulation of cars, or planes, or tanks, or nuclear missiles, or anything else in the world.";negative
"It seems to me the only ""nutty"" position is when one believes there should be no regulation, or when they begin to fear slippery slopes so much they refuse to even address common sense solutions to a clear problem.";negative
1892 was not a typo.;negative
I was talking 19th century before England gun regulation.;neutral
It is a fact that there were less gun deaths by number before England enacted regulation compared to now, but I don't know what the actual rate was.;negative
I was simply asking why gun deaths haven't been eliminated if 1 person was killed with a gun per year BEFORE gun regulations went into place.;negative
"What about the far left ""news"" sources.";neutral
Do you know how many times I have heard how many people have been murdered since the Newtown shooting?;neutral
How come no one cared about these people before the shooting?;neutral
Why don't they talk about whether that number is high, medium, or low?;negative
Why don't they talk about whether this is going up or going down?;negative
The left puts a spin on the news too.;positive
For 4 years all of the gun nuts were telling me Obama is coming after our guns, and I thought they were crazy.;negative
But, what do you know, in his first term in office he ends up calling for gun regulation, and all of the gun nuts were justified.;negative
I don't have access to the CCP database like you, can you provide your murder rate numbers for the last 3 years for America?;negative
I like how anti gun people say we need to protect everyone from the rare gun events by banning guns, but when someone suggests banning the more frequent hammer and club attacks, they can justify those deaths.;negative
If, like you have said, assault rifles provide me the same protection as handguns, why should I give them up?;negative
You don't have common sense.;negative
You tell me that gun violence and crime in England can't be helped because of economics and living situation, but in America it is solely because of guns being legal.;negative
That is not completely true... there are different fields or areas;negative
It's still legal to own a gun in Germany.;neutral
They have a decently large population with guns.;neutral
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Germany;neutral
So, this link just proved my point.;negative
They can still carry and own firearms.;positive
nonononooonoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo;neutral
Yes it does.;neutral
Really, you can't prove your point.;negative
This one you can't win.;negative
It depends on how many they have in the first place... Every country has diffrent ways which ONLY work for them and MIGHT work for others.;negative
The number of guns owned by civilians is around 25 million, or 30.3 firearms per 100 people.;negative
Look what happend to USA this could happen again... innocent people getting killed.;negative
Maybe some parts... if you are like in military you need guns and if your a normal oridnary person you should not have guns... you could easily kill anyone.;negative
You can have self defence with the POLICE... and other things unless you are actually really really trained and use it carefully (unlike Oscar Potorius who shoots randomly even though I think he murdered his girlfriend);neutral
Maybe they should do more training....;neutral
people in Military and are experinced can use it outside of Military?;negative
Just dont use them at all and everyone is safe!;positive
if someone has a gun when they are not suppose to just call someone and get it sorted!;neutral
Guns wont be accesable!;neutral
I know enough about guns to know how to use them.;neutral
Never point at someone or joke around with it and put the safty on when your not using it.;negative
There are already so many guns out there banning them would only effect people who obey the law.;negative
Mass murders would still happen.;negative
Ban guns a a aweful idea.;neutral
Haha!;neutral
I am useing the wrong side!;negative
My mistake!;neutral
Weird!;negative
HAHA!;neutral
Okay anyways people are safer with guns because it protects us from rapest and people like prodgee.;negative
Well, thats all people!;negative
A full gun ban on citizens would be a dream come true.;negative
I hope it can one day become reality in America.;positive
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
2) Police can be very quick they are just somewhere around the area... Usually the police arrive before someone gets killed.;negative
3) If you get a gun license you could easily go outside and kill a bunch of people....;negative
very very easily;positive
7) Crimes leads to more Crimes... We need to reduce the chances of crimes Compare USA with UK and see the diffrence... UK is safer.;negative
So, you are clearly against guns for absolutely no reason.;negative
You are for banning guns no matter what.;neutral
I asked you if it was less safe to ban guns and you still think it is a good idea.;neutral
England's murder rate was not really affected by gun control.;negative
England has always had a lower murder rate than USA.;negative
They took away guns in England and the murder rate didn't change;neutral
but it is still less than USA;neutral
so you are the one who says look, getting rid of guns works.;neutral
What about this Harvard study?;neutral
Every statistic I have ever seen has supported my view or has been a lie;negative
You grip to you belief that gun control works, and you're some sort of great person.;negative

There is no guarantee that hand guns won't be targeted by you anti gun nuts next, why should anyone give up their rights when you admit that assault rifles deter crime?;negative
Can gun control reduce crime in American?;negative
Is it a necessary battlle in trying to curb American's fatal attraction to firearms?;negative
Criminals, the people who commit crimes, often get their guns via illegal means.;positive
Thus shutting off their legal channel will not affect them in the slightest.;negative
As for the people who just might protect themselves with their lawfully gained weapons, now have no means to get these weapons.;negative
Gun control is like trying to keep yourself safe by holding a sword backwards, only proving to hurt yourself.;negative
It'll increase crime.;neutral
For one, guns will be 'illegal' and most criminals will still carry guns, so an increase right there.;positive
Two, people who obey the law like the sheep they are will be at the mercy of said criminals with guns.;negative
Three, guns are a constitutional right and it is a crime to take that freedom away, since it is not what our forefathers intended.;negative
And last, this will be the gateway to tyranny.;negative
If it increases crime how come countries with high gun control laws (England or Japan for instance) do not have huge amounts of crime?;negative
Heck their crime rates are pretty low in comparison to US.;negative
Now you could look to Mexico or the middle east, huge amounts of guns and huge amounts of crime, did guns increase crimes there?;neutral
Or did crimes just get committed with or without guns?;neutral
Now what about places like Norway that has lots of guns and low crime?;neutral
Seems the issue isn't guns it is something underlying about the culture that causes crime, adding or subtracting guns wont fix the issue.;negative
So you feel convicted felons, violent ones , should have their gun rights reinstated?;negative
Cause that is gun control.;neutral
(I think non violent offenders should still have their gun rights, folks are felons for 3 strikes with pot for crying out loud) Gun control does not equal taking away all guns.;negative
We already limit your right to bear arms...I mean you don't have any nuclear devices or mutated anthrax do you?;negative
Gosh I guess that is crushing your right to bear arms.;positive
Also look at all those criminals ruling over us with their anthrax and ground to ground missiles, if only we had our own then we could be safe!;negative
(Not a dig at governments!;neutral
...its not like those are the reasons we don't revolt and our military is made up of our children and brothers and sisters);neutral
Gun control aims to make crimes more difficult to commit crimes with guns.;negative
Where gun control is the price of illegal guns goes up, making it harder for criminals to acquire guns....you don't want to make it more difficult to make criminals to obtain their weapons?;negative
Heck because we all can't have things like ground to ground missiles is why it is so hard to get...I hear.;negative
I am sure you will cite the study that shows where concealed carry was instated that crime went down, but many experts are quick to point out that surrounding areas also saw a drop in crime that didn't have concealed carry.;negative
But have you noticed that there isn't reams of studies on this issue?;neutral
Really there should be, but any rhetoric in the states about guns is pretty superficial at best.;negative
"In the US the discussion goes something like this ""OMG Obummer and NATO want to take ALL of our guns OMG"".";negative
There is no discussion on the topic only soap boxing.;negative
Studies for gun control don't get funded.;negative
Here is a link that talks about the gun control research freeze that has been in place since the mid 90's.;neutral
http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2013/02/gun-violence.aspx;neutral
But gun advocacy groups like this style of debate, keeps them from having to say anything substantial.;negative
The NRA does a good job of avoiding any rational discussion on the issue and people follow suit.;positive
No studies, no rational discourse, just maintain the course.;negative
Bah...I noticed I cast a vote for it reducing crime...in my first paragraph I noted it wouldn't do this either.;negative
Gun control is to make getting guns more difficult for criminals to obtain, not to reduce crime.;negative
I was just contesting it would increase crime.;negative
Never said guns were the solution to everything, but as far as 'gun control', I am speaking about America only.;negative
Other countries have been around since before firearms, and also have a different governmental structure and core values than we do.;positive
It will increase crime in America, England be damned.;negative
As far as 'convicted felons' go, they lose their rights when they impede upon the rights of others, far as I'm concerned.;negative
But to punish the innocent for that as well?;neutral
Seems like the government wants gun control for reasons other than 'the safety of others' to me.;negative
Also a quick note here: Don't post overly long and rambling responses.;neutral
I'll only skim some of it, at best.;positive
"""If you can't say it simply, you don't understand it well enough"".";negative
You are asserting this, but not backing the claim up.;negative
Long posts doesn't mean it isn't simple, just long.;negative
Skimming?;neutral
Your lack of backing your position up and admittance of just skimming kind of tells me you aren't looking to debate this issue, just state your opinion.;negative
I will wait to see if you post anything with substance, if not I guess we are done then.;negative
"No point in debating against the position of ""nuh uh"".";negative
Thanks for the dialogue.;positive
Yeah I guess if you're going to be a bit snooty we really are done, then.;negative
Also, Chicago comes briefly to mind.;positive
I can cite many statistics where gun control does NOT prevent violence.;negative
However, dont take my word for it.;neutral

Here is what I want you to do.;neutral
"Take any one of the three most gun control cities; Chicago, New York City, or Washington DC.";positive
Now pick your destination.;neutral
1 a crowded nightclub;neutral
2 a large family gathering at a local park;neutral
3 a crowded grocery store;neutral
4 a car show convention with lots of people;neutral
Walk in and pull a gun and demand everyones money or you will kill them.;neutral
Now do the exact same thing in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where gun control laws are very lax.;negative
Report back on this board and tell us where you had the most success.;positive
Of course you better start in one of the three gun control cities first.;neutral
Banning the guns won't help.even if the guns are completely banned and they are not in use anymore the criminals will surely find some other way out for spreading the crime.If crime has to be eradicated completely then the basic criminal mentality of the criminals has to be changed.;negative
Gun control is a law or a series of laws out lawing the private ownership of firearms.;negative
Criminals are people who break laws.;neutral
Do you see how the former might mean absolutely jack all to the latter?;positive
If you do then give yourself a pat on the back because you do in fact have basic reasoning skills.;negative
It'll increase crime.;neutral
guns are a constitutional right and it is a crime to take that freedom away;negative
It will increase crime in America, England be damned.;negative
Also a quick note here: Don't post overly long and rambling responses.;neutral
I'll only skim some of it, at best.;positive
"""If you can't say it simply, you don't understand it well enough"".";negative
Gun control is a very contentious issue.;negative
I will be presenting pro and con opinions, facts on guns including links to reputable websites consisting of facts and statistics.;negative
In preparing this article, I came to the realization that both sides have rights with valid concerns and beliefs.;positive
Each side needs to be heard, it is our right and freedom to express ourselves.;positive
Perhaps through compromise, there can be amicable resolutions that will help us make a difference through change.;positive
When done in good faith and not fear, our freedom can remain intact and lives saved.;positive
I would say that's a win-win for both sides.;neutral
Perhaps a broader focus can provide a better understanding as to concerns and answers surrounding gun violence and the need to implement fair and effective laws.;negative
I believe guns are but a symptom of a more underlying problem existing within our society today.;negative
We could discuss the reasons and possibilities as to why mass shootings and/or violence seem to be increasing while placing blame on this person or that group.;negative
However, if focus can be placed on the why, what, when and how through conversation, we may be able to move beyond gridlock.;neutral
There are currently approximately 32,000 yearly gun related deaths in the united states.;negative
This has increased by 4,000 yearly since the year 1999, not only should this number NOT be increasing it should be DECREASING.;negative
The fact of the matter is that gun violence is an escalating issue within our country that we must address.;negative
Background checks, limitations on bullet magazine sizes, and types of weapons sold legally MUST be used to reduce the death and destruction that is caused by loose control on guns.;negative
There are various case studies that clearly demonstrate the efficacy of increased gun regulations on the level of deaths within a country.;negative
After an outbreak of gun violence in the 1990s, the Australian government legislated broad bans on guns and strict regulations on their possessions.;negative
"These included the need to demonstrate a ""genuine purpose"" for the ownership of small arms, air guns, and paint markers, and a ""genuine need"" for other weapons such as pump action or semi-automatic rifles.";negative
Weapons such as assault rifles, full automatic rifles, or missile launchers were banned from civil distribution completely.;negative
Fifteen years later gun violence has dropped significantly, most notably it dropped by 47% the year after the legislation's inception and 30% the next year.;negative
The buyback of guns by the government has been linked to a 75% drop in gun suicides.;negative
The journal of law and economics reports today that the laws have caused a total reduction of 59% of gun deaths since 1995.;negative
Before the laws came into place there were 13 gun massacres in Australia, since then there have been none.;negative
In japan it takes weeks of complicated paper work to acquire a permit for a gun.The new york times reports that In japan there were 11 gun deaths in 2012 versus 30,000 in the united states.;negative
Adjusted for populations that is one death for every 11,600,000 people as opposed to approximately one death for every 10,000 people in the united states.;negative
"As Michael Bloomberg said ""We are the only industrialized country in the world with this problem.";negative
"in the whole world, the ONLY one.""";neutral
There is no tangible reason for the opposition to background checks or any other form of regulation on the legal holding of firearms.;negative
A comprehensive background check on individuals who would like to purchase guns would not affect them other than to bind them legally to their actions with those weapons.;negative
Since people who are buying weapons for self defense or hunting or recreation have no reason to be stopped from purchasing guns then they will not be affected.;negative
Despite a majority of the developed world having strict gun laws and comprehensive checks on the individuals using them, those countries have not fallen into the distopian autocratic dictatorship which the NRA and conservative pundits like to imagine.;negative
Clearly in countries where armed civilians are completely illegal whether as weapons or not, such as Egypt, the citizenry has been able to overthrow their oppressive governments.;negative
All of which would never occur in the united states because it is an operating democracy with actual (believe it or not) representation of the populace.;negative
Current gun laws within the united states are woefully inadequate and equipped to deal with the problem of gun violence.;negative
Numerous examples, many of which you have probably heard of, exist in which mentally unstable people have been sold firearms or have acquired them easily and then caused massive death and sorrow.;negative
"Most notably THIS WEEK a military specialist undergoing psycho-analysis for symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and who had been listed as ""At Risk"" for a psychotic break, purchased a .45 caliber pistol at ""guns galore"" (the same store that sold guns to the shooter of fort hood in 2009) and opened fire on a military base.";negative
This resulted in the injury of 16 people and the death of 4.;negative
This is a perfect example of how a simple background check would have identified this individual as unable to purchase a weapon and therefore discouraging his violent break.;positive
In addition this negates the ridiculous and genuinely offensive argument that had people had MORE weapons there would have been a Hollywood style gun fight in schools or in public and by some miraculous and illogical feat of luck the attackers would have been neutralized by civilians without any deaths or consequences.;negative
Not only does this suggest that having open gun fights in public is acceptable and PREFERABLE to the current situation, it is also completely devoid of thought or consideration for the actual victims in a situation.;negative
Shockingly the assailant shot up a military base filled with trained soldiers and still managed to kill and injure people before escaping, driving to another building and killing more people before killing himself.;negative
The fact is that firearms, and the laws(or lack thereof) regarding them, are facilitating the death of thousands of people within the united states.;negative
Gun regulation, in conjunction with education and public health laws, must be used to help alleviate the problems that face our solemnity.;negative
There is no need to significantly affect legal and responsible gun owners however, the loose sale of firearms is irresponsible and dangerous.;negative
Request for general firearm and violence source citations.;neutral
Do you have specific citations for any of the statistics you have reported?;neutral
I am curious to know whether the research investigates correlation or actually controls for mitigating variables to establish a causal relationship between particular gun control measures and reduced firearm violence.;negative
Request for specifically mental health related source citations.;neutral
I am also interested to know what knowledge you actually possess around the issue of mental illness as it relates to prevalence and relative proclivity towards violence.;negative
Given my research and your relative lack of statistical references around your particular points on this matter, I am led to suspect you are jumping to conclusions about this particular relationship.;negative
My research on mental illness and violence, and the case against screening against mental disorder for firearm permits.;negative
The Facts:;neutral
"26.2% (1 in 4; 816,100,000) of Americans live with a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year; roughly 6% (1 in 17; 18,800,000 people) live with a serious, disabling mental disorder (source).";negative
Despite this, roughly 60% of adults and 50% of youths do not receive mental health services (source).;negative
"""Mental disorders are neither necessary nor sufficient causes of violence.";negative
Major determinants of violence continue to be socio-demographic and economic factors.;negative
Substance abuse is a major determinant of violence and this is true whether it occurs in the context of a concurrent mental illness or not.;negative
"[...] Members of the public exaggerate both the strength of the association between mental illness and violence and their own personal risk"" (source). """;negative
"[...] too little is known about the social contextual determinants of violence, but research supports the view the mentally ill are more often victims than perpetrators of violence"" (source).";negative
The Argument;neutral
Screening for a history of mental illness as part of the background check for a firearms permit is a misguided attempt to curtail gun violence.;negative
Firstly, there is no actual causal relationship between mental illness and a propensity for violence that is any higher than in the general population.;negative
"Secondly, the screening process would miss most individuals diagnosable with a mental illness to begin with given poor treatment rates in the nation; it is would definitely miss those not having sought care who are the ones most likely to be unstable (presuming the link between mental illness and violence actually existed to begin with).";negative
Thirdly, you are penalizing and restricting the equity of a quarter of the population based on a misconception of mental illness and in pursuit of what will be an ineffectual policy.;negative
Fourthly, without entering into a debate about the actual relative success of the use of fire-arms in self-defense I would claim that individuals have a right to choose to carry in their own defense and that by extension those more at risk to violence have an even stronger claim (in fact, other nations with stronger restrictions include increased risk of violence as a basis for having a legitimate reason to request an ownership permit).;negative
"Finally, it is positively reprehensible that the only thing galvanizing mental health care reform in the decades of systemic neglect is the misdirected and prejudicial attack on the those living with mental illness; it is, of course, far easier to falsely target a group than to actually address the real issues in our society.";negative
Alternative Suggestion for Curtailing Firearm Violence;neutral
Actually target the root causes of gun violence.;neutral
Certainly, basic background checks for an actual history of violence (rather than unreliable, prejudicially assumed predictors of violence) are reasonable.;neutral
There is also no real reason why anyone needs to own anything that could be used for something other than self-defense or hunting.;negative
Beyond that, however, violence will continue to happen regardless of the weapon used unless we actually address the true causes of violence.;negative
As noted in the research I cited, the most predictable variables for violence are socio-demographic and economic.;negative
Addressing poverty and economic insecurity would be a far more successful tract to addressing violence.;negative
Setting aside unfounded assumptions and investing in further research into other actual causes of violence that differentiate the U.S. from other nations (or make it comparable) would also be a worthy direction.;positive
I stopped reading after your first 2 sentences were impossible.;negative
If something grows by 4,000 a year for 15 years it has to be over 60,000.;negative
It is called math.;neutral
You should learn that before discussing guns.;neutral
If you look at the statistics for homicides committed with firearms you can see that they have decrease 39% since 1993.;neutral
The overall trend is that there is less violent crimes committed with guns.;negative
Gun bans in China does not stop crazy people from stabbing people to death.;negative
There are going to be mass attacks done if you ban guns or not.;negative
"Especially if you ban ""assault"" rifles and not handguns.";negative
Colombia has the highest amount of deaths due to guns, but they are illegal there.;neutral
Switzerland is an industrialized nation which has done fine with having a large portion of the population armed with SiG assault rifles.;positive
Most violent crime there are done by foreigners who have gotten guns illegally.;negative
BTW 40% of criminals confess to acquiring guns illegally.;negative
There are too many factors in a hypothetical revolution to say it could be done without a armed populace.;negative
And to say that a democracy can't turn totalitarian is false, Hitler became leader of Germany democratically after Hindenburg kicked the bucket.;negative
I wouldn't like to find out either.;negative
Is it possible that Mubarak got to be the dictator he was due to the fact that he had nothing to fear from the people he was oppressing?;negative
Background Checks - of course we want those.;neutral
I would like to see your sources for the fact that states that firearm homicides have decreased by 39% because gunpolicy.org as well as the CDC(a government agency) report that while total homicides have decreased gun related homicides have increased from 9,257 in 1998 to 11,101 in 2011.;negative
The idea that we should tailor our legal policy to what criminals will presumably abide or not is ridiculous, these laws would obviously have enforcement.;negative
"Also the idea that "" a crazy person with knives"" will kill even close to as many people as a person with a fully automatic assault rifle or even a pistol not only lacks common sense, but is separate to the argument.";negative
I am actually from colombia, I have done extensive research into the problems that our country faces.;negative
The past two decades have seen an incredible rise in violence and organized crime due to the influx of the illegal drug trade and partially the united states drug code and policies(its not all the u.s.'s fault, just partially,).;negative
The statistics of gun deaths in colombia are impossible to unpack from the environmental situation and therefore are completely incomparable to the united states or any other industrialized nation.;negative
Switzerland operates a citizen militia and therefore requires its citizens to train with firearms constantly.;negative
it also has a GDP per capita of 46,000 which is higher than the u.s., as well as 25% of the population holding a higher degree and 99% of the population being able to read and write as opposed to the u.s. ~80%.;negative
The federal department of justice and police also did a case study in switzerland and determined that the reason for it's high immigrant crimminality rate was due to the countries large acceptance of political assylum seakers who arrived with little education, no knowledge of a modern economy, and no ability to operate in an industrialized nation.;negative
In addition to all this which skews the statistics in fact switzerland has a comprehensive regulation of fire arm sales.;negative
"To purchase a gun in a commercial shop one must have a ""Waffenerwerbsschein"" or weapons acquisition permit that includes a phsyciatric exam and a full criminal records check.";negative
in order to buy a weapon from an individual a check from the crimminal records bureau is needed.;neutral
breech loading or muzzle loading rifles can be bought however suppressors, automatic weapons, selective fire weapons, and certain accessories such as large ammunition holders is completely prohibited.;negative
The revolution in germany was under completely different circumstances.;negative
After the end of the war the democratic Wienmar republic was the governing body that took control of germany, this had a terrible system and ineffective rulers.;negative
The reperations that germany had been forced to pay were so large that the government literally did not have enough cash to pay them, they therefore decided to print more money, This spiraled into a vicious circle of runaway hyper-inflation in which a couple billion german Marks couldnt buy a loaf of bread.;negative
Famine, crime, death and destitution ensued causing a complete wipe out of the middle class and the reduction of population and living standard of what was previously the most industrialized nation in the world.;negative
The loss of the middle class causes an inherent radicalization of the populace, the middle class has an active stake in the stability of a political system within a country, the lower and upper classes not as much.;negative
Therefore hitler, who was an opportunist as well as a political and oratorical genius, took control democratically.;negative
However, a similar situation will most likely never happen in the united states, and brandishing our assault rifles in preparation for a day that will never come is illogical and wasteful as well as pessimistic and borderline insane.;neutral
I find your comment about Mubarak hilarious because the only reason he stayed in power was due to heavy american aid and political support.;negative
We placed him in power over the Egyptian people and propped up his dictatorship in exchange for a steady supply of oil.;negative
so yeah... awkward...;negative

"Mubarak is just one of many dictators; I can change his name to Stalin, Mao, etc. to make the point relevant.";negative
I guess all those gun-less Ukrainians would have wanted to fight against Stalin during the Holodomor but oh well.;negative

Woops.;neutral
Egypt isn't an oil producing country.;negative
Didn't the Egyptian Army back the people?;negative
What if they didn't?;neutral
the unemployment rate of the wienmar republic in 1932 was 30% a year before hitler's Ascension to power.;negative
The great depression which hit germany particularilly hard in addition to the hyperinflation of the past decade is widely accepted as the reason for germany's radicalization.;negative
Stalin came to power by out pilitiking and eventually murdering Trotsky after Lenin came into power after decades of bloody civil war.;negative
Mao came into power through armed revolution also.;neutral
Even if a dictator was democratically elected in the united states, that would defeat the purpose of having weapons.;negative
if we democratically elected them, why would we then need guns to fight them?;negative
Once again the Holodomor has no comparison to the united states because our government is not only not communist, not totalitarian, and not a federation of socialist republics, there is no way for our government to ever BECOME that for the simple reason that a majority of Americans DESPISE that form of government and would never allow for its rise in the united states.;negative
Yes the egyptian army did back the people, that is the point!;negative
the people despite not having weapons were victorious.;neutral
because a dictatorship without the support of operational civilians cannot exist in the long run.;negative
this has been proven through historical precedence.;neutral
We can not predict that America will always be how it is today or was in the past.;negative
What is to say that 50-100 years from now we have a totalitarian govt?;neutral
You cannot predict the future.;negative
Hopefully we become more altruistic and do not need to have weapons in 50-100 years, but maybe we do.;neutral
Ukrainians were unarmed and were starved to death.;negative
Protesting would have gotten them killed faster.;neutral
If they were potentially armed they could at least have a fighting chance.;neutral

"The side with weapons ""won"" that, and it wasn't the protesters.";positive
Background checks that screen for a history of violence are logical.;negative
Banning or severely restricting access to non-defensive, non-hunting firearms also makes sense.;negative
Extending these restrictions to target those living with mental illness I disagree with.;negative
I can elaborate upon any of this upon request.;neutral

People who are gun nuts have their heads in the sand.....................................;neutral
Funny how you had to put so many dots in your statement to get it though .;positive
But seriously , give an actual reason as to why the have their head in the sand .;negative
In my opinion , people who are for gun control have their heads in the sand and believe whatever the media tells them to .;negative
Gun control will lead to more violence .;negative
If we have gun restrictions noncrazy people will have a hard time getting guns because they abide by the law .;negative
But the people who do want to kill others are already committing a crime so they will say screw it and get a gun illegally which isn't that hard.;negative
This will make their job easier since the cops will need to stop them and have you noticed how poorly the police have been doing their job lately .;negative
No offense but take your finger off the trigger and stop shooting at the first thing you see.;neutral
Strict gun control is needed in America in order to curtail this shameful violence.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral

"Not for retaining the ""Status Quo"" but for banning or heavily restrict the purchasing and ownership of handguns while keeping rifle ownership perfectly legal.";negative
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics ~73-83% of gun related crimes are done with handguns.;negative
Handguns are the type of weapon that are most widely used and kill thousands each year.;neutral
The majority of gang violence is done with handguns, the majority of other violent crimes & disputes, and a good portion of mass shootings(ex.;negative

"Handguns are now able to penetrate body armor(FN 5.7) and are ever increasing in magazine capabilities; they are every bit as ""scary"" as rifles.";negative
Banning rifles would not do anything to decrease the bloodshed.;negative
The 2nd Amendment was not written for personal defense, it was written to give citizens a chance in a hypothetical future revolution against a tyrannical govt.;negative
(which likely won't happen but it could).;negative
Banning rifles would put the citizens in grave danger in this scenario, banning handguns only would not.;negative
Your premise of a static interpretation of the Second Amendment right to bear arms defeats your own argument.;negative
If rifles are so financially inaccessible and impractical as to render them non-influential in firearms violence, then by extension a citizen militia would be poorly equipped to revolt using what becomes a limited resource (both financially and strategically).;negative
Looking beyond your narrow interpretation of the Second Amendment to include more contemporaneous common law and legislative interpretations of the right to bear arms, self defense has a legitimate legal basis.;negative
Arguably, handguns are a more practical self defense firearm in terms of affordability and portability if nothing else.;negative
Firearms are far more symptomatic of deeper social problems than they are a direct problem themselves.;negative
I support basic background screening for violent histories, firearm safety training, and the restriction of firearms not primarily usable for self-defense or hunting... but beyond those further restriction becomes unreasonable in light of the aforementioned reality.;negative
this should be on the other side, that does not sustain the status quo and therefore is in conflict with that side.;negative
I think background checks are common sense and no one will be against them.;negative
"I am against banning ""assault"" weapons, rifles, longarms, etc.";negative
Being pro-rifle, I see myself more on this side than the other.;positive
The only reason that assault weapons deaths are so low is because of a comprehensive ban on them from 1994 to 2004 in the united states.;negative
During that time the bureau of justice statistics reports that rates dropped from 8 people per 100,000 to 4 per 100,000.;negative
this is the fastest drop in deaths throughout the entire history of the united states.;negative
"Since instituting background checks literally is against the definition of ""status Quo"" your argument should in fact be on the other side.";negative

Although the public generally perceives medical research as the highest order of precision, much of the epidemiologic research is, in fact, rather imprecise and understandably so because it has been conducted principally by individuals with no formal education and little on-the-job training in the scientific method.;negative
I am for strict gun control because it is now 2015 and the gun violence is continuing to rise.;negative
Awful!;negative
The two most significant federal statutes controlling firearms in the civilian population are the national firearms act of 1934 and the gun control act of 1968.;negative
The 1934 act established strict registration requirements and a transfer tax on machine guns and short-barreled long guns.;negative
"The 1968 act prohibits mail-order sales and the interstate sales of firearms, prohibits transfers to minors, limits access to ""new"" assault weapons, and sets forth penalties and licensing requirements for manufacturers, importers, and dealers.";negative
Sometime's I think it's not right get a gun in your home.Cause something can happen in your own home.One of your kids will think it's a toy or a game.;negative
Consequently, studies are often poorly designed and data are often inappropriately analyzed and interpreted.;negative

THe AR-15 was also not Automatic, it was simiautomatic.;negative
The argument that he would get the gun elsewhere is BS.;negative

Assult weapons save many in the military, which is besides the debate but i thought it would come up.;negative
I don't need an assult weapon but others do for a few reasons.;neutral

Fear of others.;neutral

2.;neutral
Fear of the government.;neutral

According to havocscope an AK47, an actual automatic assault rifle, costs about 400$.;negative
That's less than a video game counsel these days.;negative
And illegal arms dealers pay towards anyone with the right cash.;negative
Last AK47 was made in June 1953 and it's in museum.;neutral
Authentic ak-47 type 1 costs more than $30 000 (it's a collectible stuff) You and your havoc scope are most probably talking about AKM and it's clones.;negative
"Those $500 AKs are build from ""decommissioned"" pieces (kissed by automatic hammer) with some home made parts.";negative
I saw them, yes they shoot but not in full auto, it would just blow up.;negative
You can buy them in Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia... You cannot buy these in US.;negative
Proper AR in good condition costs 10x more and again it would not to be sold to random guy it's very very risky.;negative
You cannot buy it for less that $2000.;negative
Those weapons are imported to US if you would be willing to sell them for $500 why do so in place where is it illegal?;negative
For same money you may sell it in places where no one cares without paying smugglers.;negative
According to this roughly 75 million AK47s (don't blow up in your hand) exist today, only 5 million being originals.;negative
That's the sourced part.;neutral
Unsourced says that small tribes use them.;negative
And havocscope, a meta collection of criminal databases, confirms the prices.;negative
However, I would like to know more about how non-authentic AK type weapons will just blow up in your hand... You'd think they wouldn't be one of the most popular black market weapons if they were unreliable.;neutral
The modern AKs are actually one of the most reliable black market weapons because of its durability.;positive
Even the M16 and M4s could never match up to its durability until recently.;negative
And, according to the original link, in California an AK47, knockoff or not, is less than 500 dollars.;negative
most of aAKs are decommissioned the way that something like huge hammer hits it in barrel and around the trigger.;positive
After that it's classified as a metal scrap and it's not controlled anymore.;negative
After that they are being repaired from home made spare parts usually made from random metals/materials that tends to expand after heated up.;negative
Cheap something-like barrel gets slightly thicker and bullet stuck... full auto is a bad idea... I've had this way restored cz58.;negative
The Californian AK will be something very similar.;neutral
AKs are reliable because of loose parts m16/4 are build differently.;neutral
You are comparing apples with oranges.;neutral
Here is a little statistic for you, America ranks 107th homicide rates, but ranks 1st in gun ownership.;negative
From 1960 to 2010 our homicide rate has dropped from 5.1 per 100,00 to 4.8 per 100,000 however violent crime rates have risen from 160.9 per 100,00 people to 403.6 per 100,000.;negative
After 70 years of gun control you have slightly lowered the homicide rate but drastically increased violent crime.;negative
"Gun control doesn't stop illegal gun sales, its like saying ""lets make drugs illegal, it will take them off the street.""";negative
Criminals will still get the banned guns, the problem with mass shootings is not guns, but its crazy people, you can't fix crazy by banning weapons.;negative

Only difference is that law abiding citizens can not have them but criminals can.;negative
When you bring any weapon into a school zone you have broken a ton of laws, a few more about firearms would not have stopped anything.;negative
Gun control fails.;negative
You didn't address that since we have started adding more and more gun control that violent crimes have gone up and how even though America is #1 in gun ownership it tanks only 107th in homicide rates.;negative
30 000 shot people in US a year, more that whole Europe together That's quite extreme.;positive
Why do you need automatic Assault rifle for self defense?;negative
What about mortar?;neutral

What about UK or Japan?;neutral
You don't have assault rifles so you can shoot at deer, you have it to resist oppressive governments.;negative
What about the 2011 UK riots?;neutral
In places where only the government have weapons its called a police state.;negative
In the UK criminals have more access to guns that law abiding citizens, seriously, its illegal to buy an airsoft gun unless you are part of a club.;negative
Common UK police man has no weapons same in Japan.;negative
Resist oppressive governments?;negative
Sounds like Kentucky redneck thinking that he and his cousin-father can beat Air force.;negative
Most UK police have no weapons?;neutral
Oh, that makes sense, so when they see someone with a weapon committing a crime they have to call for someone who actually has a gun to help, great job protecting people.;positive
You and your cousin can't beat the air force, a large citizen militia could stand a chance against an army.;negative
If you don't think that bad things can happen in government and that you shouldn't be able to defend yourself, well, that says a lot about you.;negative
In UK nobody has gun, there is practically no gun crime, it's extremely rare.;positive
I've never seen police man with a weapon.;neutral

You cannot defend yourself against government, whole that idea is a stupid fallacy.;negative
"Most ""Red necks"" don't just buy a pistol and go ""we'll lordy lordy I can take down the whole army"" and our military is not constantly drilling and preparing.";negative
You have to remember two things: 1.;neutral
many people who own high powered weapons practice 2.;neutral
our army is made up of mainly weekend soldiers that have never seen combat, most of them just went to boot camp and then were labeled as part of the reserves.;negative
"Boot camp is two week training, most of these ""rednecks"" use their guns on a weekly basis.";negative
Also you fail to understand how a war on civilians works.;negative
You send a drone in and kill 10 rednecks.;negative
You can guarantee that there will be a good amount of their friends and family that will take up arms against the organization that killed them.;positive
Also if a country is opening fire on their civilians and is killing a large amount that nation also has to worry about foreign opinion and intervention.;negative
You seem to have this view of the government that they don't bleed or die, they are people, they can perish.;negative
Basic military training (boot camp) is 4 months followed by another 6 month.;negative
Rednecks practice/?;neutral
...like shoot a magazine into barrel and get drunk?;neutral
You cannot compete Army, just Marines are about 200 000, 420 000 active soldiers, Air force has about 18 000 planes also there are 9000 tanks, 35000 Tomahawks ...nobody will follow you because it's a suicide run.;negative
You do not need weapons, you cannot fight Government or anybody else, you are just danger to yourself and innocent people walking around.;negative
Statistically 12 drunk rednecks will shot each other before I respond to your next reply.;negative
Its rather biased of you to assume that anyone to think about rebellion must be a drunk redneck, actually, thats really biased of you.;negative
Even if you couldn't fight the government during a time of oppression (which you could) you would still need guns to defend yourself against criminals.;negative
hand gun, lower caliber .22 or so is for self defense enough, two clips limit.;negative
Psycho tests and compulsory training... Similar system is in Czech Rep.;negative
One must be really idiot or mentally f*cked redneck thinking that Gov will oppress him and he will fight back :D;negative
One low powered hand gun with two clips, thats it?;negative
By the way, there is no such thing as a pyscho test, if you are refering to a mental health test these are usually expensive.;negative
Yes one low powered gun is enough to stop aggressor/s.;negative
That testing isn't so expensive and I find quite important that a person who wants to carry deadly weapon around is not some sort of mental.;negative
So deadly weapons should require testing?;negative
Alright, better make tests for knives, bats, crowbars, chainsaws, gasoline, cars (mental tests to), hanging out in groups ect.;negative
guns are designed just and only to kill another people, you are just blabbing.;negative
Psycho tests does works.;neutral
"""That testing isn't so expensive and I find quite important that a person who wants to carry deadly weapon around is not some sort of mental.""";negative
- Banana_Slug;neutral
knives, bats, crowbars, chainsaws, gasoline, cars, even just hanging out in a group are all deadly weapons.;negative
So should you be required to take a mental test over all these simply because they have the potential to be deadly?;negative
Seriously, from the products in your laundry room you could make chlorine gas, which is a deadly chemical weapon (was used in WWI);negative
Its not babbling its an argument you just don't want to get into, you can kill a ton people with things other than guns.;negative
As I said before, Guns are item designed to kill another people, they have no other use, you cannot cook with them or build a house.;negative
It's an item with only one purpose, to kill another human being.;negative
So if someone is going to buy weapon there could be only one reason why... that's why civilized countries tests potential gun owners.;negative
Yes you may kill person with pencil but the purpose of pencil is to write things down and wast of majority of them have been are and will be used that way.;negative
You are blabbing, people does not need guns.;negative
Yes, we do need guns.;neutral

Bad guys are the people that give guns a bad rap.;negative
"Guns are an equalizer; a way for the weak to defend against the strong.";negative
Every firearm owner knows that since they own a weapon, they must carry the responsibility of owning it, taking care of it, and being smart with it.;positive
The vast majority of guns do NOT kill people.;negative
Let me give you an example:;neutral
99.9% of guns in American are not used in a crime, only .1% are.;negative
Only 4% out of that .1% were guns that were obtained legally.;negative
Guns are used 4 times more in self defense and in those cases, 98% of the time it is not fired.;negative
Cars kill more people than guns annually.;negative
There were 33,883 car fatalities in 2009, versus 9,146 gun homicides in 2009.;negative
Out of those gun homicides, 366 were caused by a legally obtained firearm.;negative
The rest were illegally obtained.;neutral
And I don't think it conditions people that killing is okay.;negative
Criminals do not have the same values as the general populace, so they view killing as okay, but not some average joe defending his home.;negative
Gun control does not work.;negative
These facts came from the FBI and the CATO Institute.;neutral
You want to deny the FBI?;negative
Guns are designed to kill.;negative
Handguns and assault rifles are specially designed to kill another human begin.;negative
Why do you thing that 5.56 was chosen for assault rifles as a standard?;negative
I was not for it's long range accuracy nor ability to penetrate materials, it was specially designed to cause maximum harm to human beings.;negative
Shooting isn't real sport same as poker isn't.;negative
You can use low powered weapons for shooting.;negative
0.1% of guns in US = 300 000 guns used in crime.;negative
"Your .4% number is a BS, wast majority of guns used to kill people in US were legal purchased in gun stores but one buys guns for multiple people and that makes them ""illegal"".";negative
Guns that killed people in the latest shooting are technically illegal too because they were his mother....;negative
In US about 30 people a day being shoot.;neutral
UK & Japan no guns allowed 0 shootings a year.;negative
"It's just a stupid fallacy forced into your simple mind by gun companies that you ""need"" a gun.";negative
Nobody does.;neutral
Buy a Pepper Spray - it works!!!;neutral
The 5.56 was designed to wound, not straight out kill.;negative
The idea behind it is that if you wound a soldier, he has to have 2 other people carry him out, thus you have 3 hostiles out of the fight.;negative
It does kill, that is true.;positive
Any well placed round can kill.;neutral
Now I cited guns used in homicides, not all gun crimes together.;negative
If we go to the 300,000 guns used in any crime, that is still 12,000 legal firearms out of 300,000 firearms used in crime.;negative
Lets say legislation makes it so that there are no guns allowed.;neutral
Congratulations, you have now prevented 12,000 gun crimes.;negative
But what about the other 288,000 that were obtained illegally?;neutral
You have now disarmed the law abiding citizen and made a haven for the criminal.;negative
The 4% number came from the FBI.;neutral
Do you want to contradict the head law enforcement agency in the United States?;neutral
In the United Kingdom, including N. Ireland, there were 46 deaths from guns in 2010.;negative
Granted, it is a lot less, but it is still there, not the 0 you claim.;negative
This comes from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.;neutral
However, even though there were less deaths, there was a surge in gun crime, death and non-death related, after the ban on guns.;neutral
It increased 35%, while handgun use in crime went up 46%.;negative
But how can this be?;neutral
You can't get a gun in the UK!;neutral
It's illegal!;neutral
Surprise!;neutral
Criminals don't care.;negative
It is only less violent because the UK has a CCTV camera for every 14 people in the UK.;negative

The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and wording of the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratification, indicates that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.;negative

It was proven that countries like UK and Japan, that are more democratic than US has banned weapons long time ago and yet the amount of killing done by any weapon is incredibly lower.;negative
You wrote to me 49 minutes ago, in that time was statistically person shot dead in US...;negative
UK has a higher violent crimes rate.;neutral
You also have to factor in that in America there is alot more gangs that in the UK or Japan.;negative
Never trade Liberty for security, you'll end up losing them both.;negative

Example:;neutral
How about now?;neutral
is it even in English?;neutral
.;neutral
Well before we answer that, we should address the more important question: how dumb are you?;negative
It was an EXAMPLE for the phrase, how had is it to understand?;neutral
Why do Americans really need heavy guns if not to shoot people?;negative
The fact is that if there were no guns America would be a much safer place.;negative
So if someone wants to protect themself from a wild animal do they need a gun?;negative
Well, if they live near an area where there are creatures such as this then I do not see a real reason why they should not have something to keep them safe, such as a small pistol to wound an animal to give them time to get away and to freedom.;negative
Surely there is no reason to walk around with a heavy machine gun to protect yourself from a bear?;negative
obviously, Black bears are ridiculous.;negative
I dunno what I'd do without my mounted mini gun on my jeep to protect me from those savage beasts >.;negative

Most Americans are as big as bears, anyway.;neutral
Hey Micmacmoc does this mean you are coming back?;neutral
Oh yeah;positive
You ever going to bring back your original account back Mic?;negative
"Forgotten the password ;)";neutral
I think that it should be the people who are in need of self-control.;neutral
Guns are good if used properly, but considering the lack of discipline by man these days, I think guns should be controlled until man becomes more responsible and worthy of holding one.;negative
Hang on there, did you just say that an instrument whose invention hinged on the will to kill things more efficiently is a good thing?;negative
No man is worthy of holding the means to end another man's life.;positive
No wonder America is so fucked.;neutral
The 2nd amendment rights should be protected, and US citizens who are well qualified to own such weapons should be able to, however implementing better gun regulations such as taking a test, and doing things to continue to ensure that guns do not fall into the wrong hands.;negative
For it is not the guns fault, but the person who is using the gun, we need to regulate these guns and make sure they don't fall into the wrong hands by implementing proper tests and procedures to do so.;negative
If guns were as regulated as automobiles, we would be in a safer environment.;negative
All weapons are controlled in the UK;neutral
... so they think;neutral
People seem to forget how effective a well loaded handbag or a book can be.;neutral
But guns are designed to kill at the press of a button(trigger), and there's little effort in that.;negative
The benifits of no gun control are far outweighed by the negatives, thus gun control is neccisary.;negative
Also in reference to the picture in the OP, gun control is like the liscence to drive a car, and the pathetic level of gun laws at the moment pretty much means nothing.;negative
Well, the past people were allowed to keep guns because those guns couldn't kill 30 people in 30 seconds.;negative
However, now people for some reason started buying modern weapons.;neutral
If guns make people safer why America is not the safest place in the world?;negative
Generally speaking guns have harmed people a lot because some mentally ill people misuse it.Every person who wants to get gun have to be pass some tests of mental health.;neutral
Nowadays it's cheaper and easier to buy a gun than a driving license.;neutral
119,079 children and teenager’s lives have been taken since 1979 by gun violence and this number will increase unless the government will fix this problem.;negative
It's beyond belief to me that any person should carry a gun , I remember my first time in the states and actually seeing armed police as an outsider (Ireland) I was shocked , now I know Americans find that strange , but by definition a gun is life threatening thus my shock .;negative
Guns have no place in society and much and all as I love the USA and its marvellous people I don't like guns .;negative
No other passage in the US Constitution is as hotly debated as the Second Amendment.;negative
In full, this controversial sentence reads:;neutral
“A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”;negative
Although most people focus on the “bear arms” part, the real key word is “militia.”;neutral
The thing is, in 1791, no-one really knew if this whole “Union” thing was going to work out.;negative
Many of the States distrusted each other, and everyone distrusted big government.;positive
The possibility of invasion was frighteningly real, and the Second Amendment was put in place to make sure that a citizen’s militia could defend the principles of the constitution.;negative
What the Second Amendment didn’t do was grant any drunken asshole the right to stagger into a gun shop and buy an assault rifle without a single background check.;negative
In 1939, the Supreme Court even ruled that:“The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with the view of its purpose of rendering effective Militia.”;negative
By 2008, they’d extended that to cover self-defense in the home—something else that doesn’t require a high-capacity magazine and the ability to kill everything within a three block radius.;negative
But that’s all they’d extended it to: there’s no constitutional “right” to carry a concealed weapon, no “right” to use armor-piercing bullets—just the right to defend yourself against intruders.;negative
And as Stephen King famously said: “if you can’t kill an intruder with ten rounds, you need to go back to the shooting range.”;negative
Reasonable gun control.;neutral
Comparing hitler and stalin to gun regulation is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen.;positive
Gun violence in America is an anathema.;neutral
Gun control is imperative.;negative
We have gun control.;negative
Now, I suppose the argument from gun control advocates is as scattered as arguments from gun advocates.;neutral
"There is little to no consensus on either side on what level of gun control is ""right.""";negative
Here are some things to note, however.;negative
The weapon used at the Elementary School and Movie theater was an AR-15.;negative
It is a semi-automatic assault rifle.;negative
As assface has pointed out in an earlier debate, this weapon is no more dangerous than your standard hunting rifle.;negative
"It doesn't ""spray"" bullets.";negative
Automatic weapons are not the most tactical nor are they the most reliable.;negative
The military rarely even uses automatic weapons.;neutral
It really does depend.;negative
So killers, either trained by the government or just lunatics, tend to not use automatic weapons.;negative
Automatic weapons are for non-skilled people who would rather unload a magazine and make sure they hit their target.;negative
They are also for people like me, who enjoy guns as a novelty.;neutral
And they are even for hunters, who are about killing the shit out of their prey.;negative
In general, when it comes to preventing these horrendous mass murders, going after automatic weapons is pointless.;negative
Going after all assault rifles is only in the right track if you get rid of all hunting rifles as well.;negative
However, assault rifles are RARELY used in gun related homicides.;neutral
Handguns are.;neutral
Handguns, in fact, are the most dangerous type of guns, for they are easy to conceal and not as expensive.;negative
However, they are the most reliable for women who need to fend off attackers for they are small and easy to use (depending on the handgun, of course.);neutral
Assault rifles are big and bulky, very difficult to conceal, and for a woman being attacked not very accessible or usable.;negative
In general, your average American prefers handguns because of its affordability and easy to carry.;negative
You are allowed to keep a handgun on your persons in states with right-to-carry laws, which is good for people whom are afraid of being attacked in dark alleys or other areas where they are at risk.;negative
So what kind of gun control would prevent a mass murder like what we've seen in the past few years?;negative
If we had a nationwide ban of all guns, it's possible that it would be difficult for lunatics, especially those who aren't very well-connected, to get their weapons right away.;negative
A killer like John Holmes wouldn't have been stopped, for he definitely knew his shit (considering how he even rigged his entire apartment with explosives, which I will get more into detail later,) however the recent murder at the Elementary school could possibly have been prevented.;negative
Or, it would have merely delayed it.;neutral
Best case scenario, the kid would have only killed his family and maybe only a few kids.;positive
Some of them would have possibly escaped, considering he didn't lock the door.;neutral
In total, we could have seen a few less deaths overall, or maybe none of them could have died.;negative
It's very possible that this kid would have not been able to chop up or beat the life out of these kids after doing it to his family, since it is far more intimate to use blunt or sharp weapons than guns.;negative
But what about explosives?;neutral
They are not hard to come by, especially if you have a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook.;negative
This kid might not have been able to make devastating explosives, but John Holmes did.;neutral
He didn't use them to kill those people at the theater because he had his AR-15, a grim but important fact to note.;negative
Now, rigging an entire theater to blow MAY take time, but not that much time.;negative
Maybe he could have gotten caught, but if not he would have killed even more.;negative
And then we look at the murders at Virginia Tech.;neutral
roughly 30 killed with handguns.;neutral
"So an all out ban and ""War on Guns"" is really the only thing we could try to prevent shootings.";negative
Explosives would become the new weapon of choice for people hoping to get a lot of kills in short times, but as a country I suppose we'd deal with it then.;negative
However, maybe disarming the populace isn't the best choice.;neutral
1.;neutral
No guarantee that this will work.;negative
Prohibition rarely works in this country, and guns are pretty much everywhere in this country.;positive
There is little to nothing we can do to get rid of the guns that are already here.;negative
Not only do guns get smuggled in here, we smuggle guns everywhere else.;negative
"America is a major gun nation, and a ""War on Guns"" would be a full-scale war that may be even more detrimental than the War on Drugs.";negative
Especially since we have enough trust issues with our police and military.;neutral
2.;neutral
Disarming the populace won't necessarily make the people safer.;negative
People have used guns in self defense for many [different cases].;neutral
More people use guns for self-defense than they do for murder.;negative
A dick load more.;neutral
It's very easy for a murderer to use a knife instead of a gun, for murder tends to be by surprise.;negative
Guns for self-defense, on the other hand, are either in fire-fights or something of the such.;negative
Not to mention it's a lot harder to apprehend someone if you only have a knife, especially if you know nothing about knife fighting.;negative
I had more reasons, but this is pretty long already.;positive
So what CAN we do to prevent these massacres?;neutral
Two main things, luckily:;neutral
1.;neutral
Loosen gun control.;neutral
Gun free zones are basically areas where you can't defend yourself or your family.;negative
School shootings are terrible and scary, but fear of the guns instead of the people doing the shooting is more of a problem than the tools of murder.;negative
If teachers were armed, they'd be far more likely to prevent a school shooting... like in Israel.;negative
Israel is a more dangerous place, so they keep their teachers armed.;neutral
It has proven to be of good results.;positive
There's the fear of unstable teachers, but that's all it is... fear.;negative
Fear, the thing that keeps us from protecting ourselves.;positive
"If a teacher wants to kill his kids, he's not going to listen to the ""gun-free"" rule put in place.";negative
However, another armed teacher could prevent him from doing too much damage.;neutral
It's more of a fact, that the greatest threat to a mass murderer is another person with a gun.;positive
2.;neutral
Focus on the Psychology of these people.;neutral
We focus so much on shifting blame, be it gun control, violent video games, or heavy metal, and we never think about the fact that these people were unstable and created by society in the first place.;negative
there are probably so many preventative measures we could have made in raising our children or spreading media that would stop these spree killings, but instead we seem to only provoke it by spreading the fear and paranoia.;negative
A lot of these people are bullied, abused, or simply not right in the head.;negative
They find that a mass murder is exactly what they need to get their emotions on the media.;negative
We as a populace eat this shit up.;neutral
"Whenever a tragedy occurs we start saying ""omg, what a monster, he's not human, he's evil,"" and avoid the fact that he was human and that we are all just as capable.";negative
Maybe our Psychology isn't fucked up like his, but something made it fucked up in the first place.;neutral
It's not the devil, it's not that he's an asshole, it's something to do both Neurologically and Socially that is causing this.;negative
This is going on for awhile, so I'll cut it short here.;negative
I hope I've made my point well.;neutral
This is so true, especially that last paragraph on psychology.;positive
"The media fails to realise that when they shovel shit like ""he was an evil monster and anyone like him should be killed"", they immediately alienate anyone who has the potential to be in the same state of mind as him, and become more likely to do terrible things like Columbine/Aurora/Newtown or whatever.";negative
I'm not saying we need to encourage these people to think the way they do, but a little less aggression and vitriol in our media would be more effective than a million gun control laws.;negative
Ditto.;neutral
Whatever you said.;neutral
"It is long so..., it must be good ;)";positive
shit, i meant to put this as my source for self-defense and gun control.;negative
sorry.;neutral
We don't need gun control we need people control.;negative
We need to make sure that people who want to kill don't get guns.;negative
In the case of newtown he got the gun from a family member but this idea would have stopped the shootings at the Seik Temple and at the Movie Theatre showing Batman.;negative
People want to ban assult rifles because they think they cause crime.;negative
If i was a criminal i would get it illagly if i wanted it.;negative
And if i couldn't get that i would get a M1 Carbine or another rifle that is simiautomatic.;negative
They want to ban assultrifles because they look scary.;negative
One could do just as much damage with another rifle or a pistol.;negative
Adolf says Hi, welcome to fascism.;positive
People control?;neutral
Seriously?;neutral
What next?;neutral
The NSA can wiretap my phone and monitor my internet usage just in case i might be planning a terrorist attack?;negative
By the way, if you want to stop the unstable from getting firearms, they probably shouldn't be available for legal purchase on every other streetcorner.;negative
so yeah.;positive
Gun regulation is necessary.;neutral
The fact that the weapons could be found, despite being banned, isn't the issue.;negative
We know that.;neutral
"The point is that someone a little fucked up on meth or some shit can't walk into walmart and walk out with a beretta and a hundred rounds of ammunition and go slaughter his ex girlfriend because she said ""hi"" one time.";negative
A meth addict can walk into walmart and buy a beretta and shoot his gf.;negative
You know there is a waiting peroid for buying a gun correct?;negative
It should be obvious that we need more guns, not less, less is the reason that got us into this mess with GUN FREE ZONE, this is a welcome mat for mass shootings.;positive
Honestly, this was closer to what I wanted to see than gun control.;negative
This shooting was the result of irresponsible gun ownership.;negative
The woman should have had her guns locked up, not out in the open.;negative
The woman knew her son was mentally unstable, and should have taken the initiative to not give him the opportunity to have access to the guns without her supervision.;negative
I am sorry to say it, but it is kind of her fault.;neutral
We need to preach gun responsibility, teach owners to lock up their guns, or hide them away, not have them easily obtainable for whoever wishes to pick them up.;negative
Gun control was not the issue here, lack of responsibility was.;negative
Indeed, this was a result of irresponsible gun ownership.;negative
Which just goes to show the lack of gun control is letting our guns fall into the hands of unexperienced and unqualified gun owners.;negative
If we put regulations in place and regulated our guns so they don't fall into the wrong hands we could prevent more accidents like this happening.;negative
Yes because let us ALL go by what they think!;positive
By your logic, we should purge all those agaisnt the country because the hold a threat to the glorious leader!;negative
(Stalin);neutral
On a serious note, though, think of Texas.;neutral

This debate is getting old.;neutral
I've seen it on several other sites.;neutral
I say just arm everyone, give them some training, then let the problems resolve themselves.;negative
and the first thing people like me would do is throw that gun away.;negative
So what does that accomplish?;neutral
the mass murder of everyone who refuses to bear arms and the appearance of some kind of sick and twisted anarchist state where the last man standing gets to rule the world?;negative
Sure, alot of problems solved all at once.;negative
Poverty disappears, world hunger no longer relevant, the environment has time to repair itself with no more human interference.;negative
But humanity dies.;negative
That's it, we're done.;positive
All because some genius decided to arm everyone.;positive
Any gun control is unconstitutional.;negative
So no, guns should not be banned nor should any type of ban be in place.;negative
2nd amendment: A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE to keep and bear arms shall NOT be INFRINGED.;negative
any law to limit type of gun used, owned, or banned guns, ammo, magazine size, etc. is by definition INFRINGEMENT of the 2nd amendment because the government is telling its people whats ok and not ok.;negative
where in any of that ideology of gun control laws does that spell freedom?;neutral
once the infringement begins with the 2nd amendment where will it stop?;negative
government says movies and video games are to violent and ban them.;negative
big macs, soda, and fries make you to fat so we'll ban those.;negative
Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free citizens.;negative
Criminals do not follow laws.;negative
That is BY DEFINITION a criminal!!!;negative
They will steal guns, get them from the black market, or from any illegal shipments from other countries if they have to.;neutral
"Most of these mass shootings happen in so called ""gun free zones"".";neutral
where gun control laws prohibit good law abiding citizens from carrying a gun to protect themselves and others.;neutral
These gun free zones like schools, hospitals, post offices, most government areas, as well as buisnesses and public conventions that post no gun allowed signs, are basically advertising to these criminals, psychos, and mass murders that this will be a easy place to slaughter people because no one can defend themselves!!!;negative
how often do you hear of a mass shooting or gun related firefight at a place where there are known 100's of gun carriers like gun shows, police stations, or nra conventions?;negative
Because criminals know some people will be packing a gun there and it will not be easy.;negative
there are thousands of stories where armed citizens stop criminals, in many cases without firing a shot and just showing the gun.;negative
The liberal media today mostly just films the major gun massacres and shootings because its big news, gets peoples attention, ratings, and promotes their agenda for gun control.;negative
Patriot, your right to keep and bear arms is not so that you can blow away the guy your wife cheated on you with.;neutral
It's to stop an oppressive government from enslaving you.;negative
"The stupid thing is, you're looking the most progressive government America has had in ages in the face and saying ""Nah, bro, we don't like that.";negative
"Fuck safety, i want my guns for all the WRONG reasons.""";negative
Obama isn't trying to infringe your rights, he's trying to save you from yourselves.;negative
every dictatorship and communist country started by taking away guns.;neutral
Hitler did so while surrounded by children, saying it was for the good of the children.;positive
True, mentally disabled and disturbed people and felons convicted of Violent crimes should not have them, we have rights.;negative
The 2nd amendment people!!!;neutral
We need to keep our guns, because we are losing rights one by one.;negative
The right to bear arms is needed or else the police and army would be the only people to have them.;negative
Oddly enough, there is a picture of President Obama Shooting a rifle at the white house.;negative
Disarmed People = Are Dominated People;neutral
Simple as that so do we really want to ban guns?;negative
Gun control is pointless.;negative
I am very anti-violence and hunting but if we take all guns away, the people we are trying to get them away from will still find a way to access them.;negative
This is as pointless as trying to ban drugs.;negative
Why take away from the people who use their weapons to hunt and such?;negative
Why do you need automatic Assault rifle for self defense?;negative
Look at countries where you cannot have any weapons?;neutral
What about UK or Japan?;neutral

That's one hour fight without looses... One drone will wipe you all out.;positive
You cannot defend yourself against government, whole that idea is a stupid fallacy.;negative
As I said before, Guns are item designed to kill another people, they have no other use, you cannot cook with them or build a house.;negative
It's an item with only one purpose, to kill another human being.;negative
So if someone is going to buy weapon there could be only one reason why... that's why civilized countries tests potential gun owners.;negative

Why is that the case?;negative
That question has yet to be answered, but one thing is clear.;neutral
Gun laws are clearly doing nothing to stop this.;negative
inevitably, we must look at some of the other countries policies to determine what they're dojng differently than we are here in the United States.;neutral
Here are a few notable differences I have stumbled across.;neutral
Switzerland, a country of about 8 million people estimates there are about 2.3 million firearms within the countries borders.;negative
But firearms were only used in just 24 Swiss homicides in 2009, a rate of about 0.3 per 100,000 inhabitants.;negative
The US rate that year was about 11 times higher.;positive
"Tsutomu Uchida, Japanese shooting instructor""In the US, people believe they have a right to own a gun.";negative
In Japan, we don't have that right.;negative
"So our point of departure is completely different.""";neutral
Japanese citizens are not given gun rights.;negative
Japan requires a citizen to go to the police station and request to purchase a firearm, undergo a psych evaluation, and can even go as far as interviewing a citizens neighbors beforehand to ask if they have a temper.;negative
Because off these extreme measures taken by the japanese government, more people were murdered with scissors(9 people) than with guns this past year in Japan.;negative
So, what is the problem with the U.S?;neutral
We seem to be right at the middle ground between Japan's very strict regulations, and switzerlands lenient policies, why is gun violence such a huge issue in America?;negative
"Martin Killias, a Swiss Criminologist recently stated that ""The key issue is how many people have access to a weapon, not the total number of weapons owned in a country.";negative
Killias said.;neutral
"""Switzerland's criminals, for example, aren't very well armed compared with street criminals in the United States.";negative
"""Killias 1.";positive
You see the majority of the firearms in Switzerland are issued to men when they join the country's conscript army,after training the soldiers generally keep the rifles and that's how most people obtain firearms there.;negative
It is very difficult to compare the U.S to switzerlands situation because our military is very different, this makes it hard to consider implementing a similar set of laws in the U.S.;negative
The two are just too different to compare.;negative
The worst idea by far is to suggest the U.S follow the Brazillian model of Gun Control.;negative
Brazil recently banned all firearms, except for when used by the police and military.;negative
Brazil also sits at the top of the list when it comes to gun violence, they are the Gun Murder Capital.;negative
Large sophisticated gangs and drug trafficers are heavily armed, often better armed than the police and they control large cities throughout Brazil.;negative
The citizens hesitate to even arm themselves for self defense because the gang influence is so strong and terrifying.;positive
The last thing we need in the U.S, is stronger gang influence and better stocked gang armory's.;negative
So, what can we do to avoid this?;negative
Perhaps trying to modify the swiss model, and allow the right to bear arms but require more extensive screening and training before purchasing a firearm.;neutral
Maybe adopt Japans strategy of requiring citizens to state their intent to the police before purchasing a gun?;neutral
Whatever it may be, we cannot settle for losing our right to bear firearms simply because of fear generated towards them.;negative
We cannot sacrifice our rights to satisfy fear.;negative

December 14, 2012;neutral
UK is a proof (40x less gun crime).;neutral
Second amendment is obsolete and does not reflects preset situation.;negative
Actually, it works perfectly fine.;positive
Gun crime has been decreasing in the past decade and is continuing to decrease more towards British levels.;negative
While 34 people die from gun homicide everyday, 2,191 people use guns for self-defense everyday.;negative
Mass shootings happened more often under the previous Feinstein laws other than prohibition.;negative
More people are buying guns in America, and the crime rate is going down.;negative
Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C have the strictest gun laws in the nation, and are the most violent.;negative
Vermont has one of the lowest crime rates in America, and they allow concealed carry without a license.;neutral
Police Officers were recently interviewed and 95.7% of them believed gun and ammunition control would not reduce crime.;negative
So, the assumption that the second amendment is obsolete is incorrect.;negative
It is actually working quite well and does accurately represent the modern day.;positive
still you have gun deaths about the level of Kenya, so don't tell me that your legislation works.;negative
Actually, the Kenyan rate is quite higher.;positive
Our laws work perfectly fine.;positive
Almost all deaths related to guns happen in areas where there are greater controls on firearms I.e Chicago, they happen in poorer areas, and the guns are illegally obtained.;negative
The solution is not getting rid of guns, but loosening laws that do not allow regular citizens to own firearms while making punishment harsher for criminals, enforcing current laws which has weakened during Obama's years, and concentrating on poorer areas.;negative
Even in the UK, when guns were totally banned crime skyrocketed over 100% in some areas, rape is double the chance compared to the US, and gang related crime is up.;negative
still UK and Japan does much better without guns than US ever did with guns.;negative
Even so, you're okay with the fact that crime increased after banning guns?;neutral
That doesn't mean that the US would be better without guns.;negative
If history is right, then banning guns in the US would dramatically increase crime all around the nation, that 34 per day number would rise, rape would rise, robbery, and the criminals would still have guns.;negative
The vast majority of the nation disagrees with gun control, the police disagree, even some Democrats disagree.;negative
Crime is actually going down with the citizens buying more guns.;negative

There's a lot to be said about religion.;positive
There's a lot to be said about guns, too, but these debate only ever focus on one aspect of firearms: regulation.;negative
It would be like if every religious debate on here (and there are a few) was talking specifically about Catholic baptism or something like that.;negative
"If gun debates like ""AK47 vs M1A1"" came up frequently I wouldn't be complaining; but these debates are all addressing the exact same issue.";negative
That can't be said for the religious debates on this site.;negative
Not as generally as it can be said for the gun debates, anyways.;negative
And there's also something to be said for the frequency.;positive
"I should never see 3 debates about gun regulation out of the 5 debates listed in ""popular debates.""";negative
That's just boring and trite and shows that the people who make these repetitious debates don't look into the subject on this site, first.;negative
Okay, yes, I rather do see your point in that case.;negative
There is certainly something to be said for variety, even within the same subject.;positive
How can you have less regulations in place where are no regulations?;neutral
improvements can be made.;neutral
for example, requiring universal background checks for ALL gun sales;negative
More gun regulations are needed.;negative
Gun violence in America is out of hand.;neutral
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral

Gun control laws only control the guns in the hands of people who follow laws.;negative
People who follow laws, aren't causing problems with the guns they own.;negative
If you aren't regulating the guns in the hands of the people who are the problem, then you are not solving the problem you are trying to solve with guns, therefore, we should not implement more regulations.;negative
Regulating guns only prevents the law-abiding from having them and does nothing to prevent them from falling into the hands who abuse them.;negative
Moreover, gun regulation is a superficial approach to an underlying problem.;negative
The state of mental health care is abysmal, and it seems logical to me that increasing social understanding of mental illness and health conditions as well as treatment and support for those experiencing mental ill-health would go a lot further in preventing gun violence.;negative
I think so to.;neutral
I found out that the person who shot up Virginia Tech was actually on drugs, but had stopped taking them.;negative
You know the commercials for anti-depressants say that a side-effect of stoppage in dose can lead to suicidal thoughts.;negative
They tested him and found no drugs in his system, even though there should have been.;negative
Being a little more careful and assertive on taking the drugs wold help.;neutral
And almost every mass shooting in America since the 20th century was done by mental people.;negative
I was not actually aware of the details about the Virginia Tech shooter, but it does not surprise me much.;negative
A lot of people living with mental illness or disorders end up with partial treatment because the system is so inadequate, and this is compounded by social ignorance surrounding mental health.;negative
I think more attention to the mental health crisis in the U.S. (and elsewhere) would reduce the amount of violence generally (not only gun violence).;negative
It would increase the likelihood of early intervention and diagnosis which makes treatment more effective.;negative
Definitely.;positive
I think it would help a bunch without having to take away away guns and piss off half the population of the US.;negative
Sorry, I meant to support your statement.;negative
Stupid computer.;negative
Ergh!;neutral
Regulate the manufacture of weapons, offer incentives for people to turn in their illegal weapons and offer amnesty, and regulate the manufacture of ammunition.;negative
"Indeed; agreed.";neutral
I think regulating manufacture is a better approach, but I am unconvinced that this would actually address the problem.;negative
The idea behind it, if I am not mistaken, is to dry up the supply.;negative
However, the sheer number of guns in circulation (legal and black market) within the U.S. and nearby countries would make such an approach rather impractical.;neutral
Someone who wanted a gun could still get one, and I do not know that regulation would greatly impact the cost of acquisition.;negative
"Perhaps I am too skeptical however; I really do not have the numbers to have a very strong opinion either way.";negative
Glad we are in agreement about mental health however.;negative
:);neutral
"I don't wish to imply that I believe these measure would solve the problem; only to help in the process.";negative
I would really like to see the mental health issue addressed, as well as ensuring comprehensive education for all fire-arms owners.;negative
I live in the south, and I've lived around guns my entire life.;positive
I wouldn't want any of my friends, family, or neighbors to go without their guns.;negative
However, there are plenty of folks 'round these parts whom I wouldn't trust with a gun.;neutral
"Maybe they've received training; perhaps they have not.";negative
"But I digress; there are many causes of gun violence and if we as a nation don't start addressing the entire problem, rather than just bickering about how many/how big guns should be, it will only get worse.";negative
Very well said, and I could not agree more with addressing the entire problem.;positive
The piecemeal approach people have been taken simply is not the answer.;negative
Like I have stated in other debates.;neutral
I believe in less regulation.;neutral
Gun control has killed over 175 million people since the 20th century.;negative
I don't want America added to that statistic.;negative

Nope.;neutral

WORLDWIDE HISTORY OF GUN CONFISCATION;neutral

Cambodia established gun control in 1956.;negative
From 1975 to 1977, one million educated people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.;negative
none of them banned weapons, you are blabbing aging also you should check how affordable weapons were.;negative
If rifle costs equivalent of present $50000 and single round $120 you will think twice if keeping rifle is better than few cows.;neutral
Uncontrolled weapon distribution like in Sudan, Somalia or US showed of as a horrible mistake and kills incredible number of people in present time.;negative
You are deluded illiterate idiot, exactly the kind of person who shouldn't have access to guns.;negative
If you suggest the government ban guns, if you trust your government to be the only ones allowed to have guns, you are naive.;negative
This is not an attack on you, think about it for real.;negative
You cannot fight government anyway so why not;negative
?;neutral
That's what gun control is, its banning and regulating guns.;negative
All of those countries banned guns.;neutral
There would have to be a lot of inflation for prices to hit that high.;negative
The average price of an illegal AK is around 500.;negative
Deluded?;neutral
I'm sorry that you are so ignorant to the point that you think that mass murder in Russia, Germany China, Turkey, Uganda, Cambodia and Guatemala are just a delusion.;negative
You are really idiot, in Russia's 1930 there we no weapon control because there were no weapons, very expensive in that times, some people could have some percussive weapons, no ban on them.;negative
in 1911 there was no Turkey but Ottoman Empire and you could have as many weapons as you wanted to have, no limits.;negative
...all of those you mentioned are BULLSHITS.;neutral
I also know where did you copy-paste it from, why did you also didn't copy paste those replies that completely destroyed that idiotic claim?;negative
Have you forgot about them?;neutral
Should I paste them in and make it copy paste tournament?;negative
Let's start with this little thing, tht your slamm brain somehow missed.;negative
http://www.gunsandcrime.org/auresult.html;neutral
What did I copy and paste?;neutral
You never crushed any claim.;neutral
Somalia and Sudan are wild, un-cultured countries, run by pirates and Islamists.;positive
Everyone of these countries I mentioned did ban weapons, that's what gun control is.;negative
Your ignorance has blinded you.;positive
And that was an improper use of illiterate you uncultured heathen!;negative
:) And I have already had access to weapons for 12 years now.;negative
I haven't killed anyone.;negative
There are no bans on weapons in Sudan or Somalia you may buy weapon on markets and even try them out in public.;negative
I was talking about my previous post.;neutral
The one with the Soviet Union, Guatamala, etc.;positive
A citizen of any of those countries couldn't have a gun of any kind.;negative
I'm from former Soviet Union, yes you could have a gun, you've just had to be a member of communist party, there could be some very local restrictions but in general you could have handguns and rifles you couldn't have explosives like grenades or RPGs.;negative
You mean you lived behind the iron curtain during the Cold War?;neutral
I'm too young, I do not remember too much but other members of my family do.;negative
"I remember shooting sewer rats with revolver and calling policeman ""comrade"" :D";negative
"Weapons were OK unless you have been to much politically ""active"" on the ""wrong"" side.";negative
"You also couldn't own ""western"" guns.";negative
Wow.;positive
That's interesting.;positive
I'm not kidding that's pretty cool.;negative
Now, I just don't like the feeling of having the gov. say when or when can't I own a gun.;negative
Or that I need to belong to the party.;neutral
Or if I'm on the wrong side.;neutral
But you could own like AK-47's or Mosin Nagants, just not Winchesters or Berettas?;negative
"Everyone was member of ""the party"", most of people with the ""red book"" wasn't even communists.";negative
"Western stuff or just $$$ was more less illegal you couldn't buy western weapons, if police would found Western gun in your property or car they would most likely declare you a spy and after two weeks of ""interrogation"" of you and most likely some your family members you would confess, or commit a ""suicide"".";negative
"This was in the times of ""Normalization"", after that (1980+) they would most likely ask just for some cash and let you go... but this depends on country.";negative
This is how it worked in former Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany, in Romania, Russia and so it was much worse but you could have a weapon but wast majority of people couldn't afford anyway, you could have food for couple of days for one bullet.;negative
System was extremely corrupted, every single time you went for something to any government office for example for building permit or anything else you had to leave there an envelope, without that the visit was just pointless.;negative
"If you did this on right place with enough thick envelope you could get a stamp that allowed to own automatic weapons or western weapons or even a tank for ""study purposes"".";negative
People weren't interested in Western weapons anyway, they never seen them and the only info they get was propaganda where it looked like garbage anyway.;negative
.;neutral
:D;neutral
News from West you've get were only Hurricanes, bank robberies, accidents, movies about underground an so.;neutral
.;neutral
For example once in middle of some shot about bank robbery in US they played a scene from Rambo where he jumps from swamp and start killing people with machine gun.;neutral
.;neutral
for people like my parents who lived 40 years in that system everything from west looked quite evil :D;neutral
That's interesting.;positive
I hadn't known that before.;neutral
Thank you for the information.;positive
Maybe not.;neutral
"But I bet you have a list of people you wouldn't mind killing and I bet I can guess who that individual is ;)";negative
I'm not sharing that with you though.;negative
This list is a top secret.;positive
If I told you, I'd have to kill you:by adding you on my list.;negative
:) Haha!;positive
Oh...,.;positive
"you laugh...., but I bet there's a drop of truth in there ;)";positive
Eh, I don't know.;neutral
I don't want to kill anyone.;negative
The only reason I would kill someone is in self-defense when my life was threatened or in service in the military.;negative
And, if we're not careful, America could become a wild, uncultured land, run by survivalists and Jesus-freaks.;negative
Same thing, really.;negative
I'm fine with Jesus-freaks.;positive
The worry I come up with is the wild, un-cultured land if citizens can't protect themselves.;positive
And in what real-world, non-hyperbolic, situation could you realistically see that being a legitimate concern?;negative
Soviet Russia was a good reason, especially during Stalin's reign.;positive
He killed over 20 million of his own people.;neutral
Criminals only had to worry about the government, and dissidents against Stalin couldn't defend themselves.;negative
Israel is an excellent place.;positive
Almost all citizens are armed because of the threat of terrorism and Palestinian hate crime against them, as well as being surrounded by countries that hate them.;negative
Even the teachers are armed.;neutral
Detroit and Chicago are good examples.;positive
Chicago has the highest homicide rate in the country by guns, yet at the same time has the toughest firearms regulations other than D.C.;neutral
So, America is Soviet Russia and Obama is Stalin?;negative
Again, a totally hyperbolic and unrealistic assumption.;negative
You're terrified of Federal Government and you're sure they're trying to disarm the public.;negative
"What you seem to be ignoring, however, is that this isn't a call for gun-control originating from the Federal Government; it is a call from the citizenry.";negative
Move there.;neutral
"They also have rampant poverty and poor education programs; it's related.";negative
Did I say that?;neutral
Obama is Stalin?;neutral
America is Soviet Russia?;neutral
I don't believe I did.;negative
If you think so, whatever man.;neutral
And if the call for guns was from the citizenry, then why is Feinstein and other congressman leading the charge?;negative
Some radicals are using this shooting as a casus belli on firearm control.;negative
Unfortunatley, Feinstein is listening to them.;negative
Israel is a nice place, but I said excellent meaning an excellent example.;positive
If poverty and poor education cause the high homicide rates, why don't we concentrate on that?;negative
Soviet Russia was a good reason, especially during Stalin's reign.;positive
In the context of this conversation on gun-control, invoking that imagery has a clear implication.;positive
You're comparing America's legislative actions on gun control to those of the former Soviet Union.;neutral
Because they are listening to their constituents and (in a rare moment of competence) doing their job.;positive
Oh, I would very much like to see those issues addressed.;negative
High homicide rates have multiple causes, among them poverty and poor education.;negative
We must address the entire problem instead of focusing on only gun-control.;negative
Well, what I'm just finding out is that the Soviets did let people own guns, but only those who were in the party and not political dissidents.;negative
I don't like having that.;negative
Feinstein is listening to her party, not the people.;negative
The majority of the people believe in staying status quo, and some believe in less regulation.;negative
Now, I admit that the margin is closing, but it's not there yet.;negative
Her job is to listen to the majority, not just her supporters.;positive
If it was such a clear majority, they should be able to use their clout to end this fairly quickly.;positive
But, there isn't such a majority.;negative
If there were, we would likely not be having this debate.;negative
There is a majority, it's just the congressmen don't listen, like they always do.;negative
We are fighting to stop this, as hard as we can.;negative
Many of the congressmen don't listen to the facts provided by their own people.;negative
They just want to do what they want.;neutral
That's the fault of the citizenry.;neutral
They shouldn't have voted for Congresspeople who wouldn't listen.;negative
Also, if they're consistently acting against your interests... gasp MAYBE THE MAJORITY ISN'T ON YOUR SIDE!;negative
But not Allah freaks?;neutral
Why the distinction?;neutral
It is possible Christianity could return to its violent past.;negative
Oh, boy.;neutral
You mean the crusades?;neutral
Those haven't happened for over 600 years.;neutral
We're more civilized now.;neutral
That is ancient history.;neutral
Do you see more active violence from Christians, or against Christians?;neutral
Christians have already condemned the crusades.;negative
"Now; at this moment.";neutral
That can change, and people like Fred Phelps are trying to make that happen.;neutral
Evangelical pastors claiming natural disasters are the work of the lord are trying to turn the world into a theocratic regime.;negative
Well, they're about due aren't they?;neutral
Fred Phelps and the Westoboro church are condemned by everyone, including many Christians.;positive
They are horrible people, and nobody takes them seriously.;negative
Radicals like them are a rare breed of crazies.;positive
And if you say the crusades are about due, man, that's just crazy!;negative
But whatever floats your boat.;neutral
I wouldn't count on it.;negative
"With the rise of radical Islam, Christianity seems to be at the ready; defensive.";negative
Says the Atheist who attacks Christianity.;neutral
We are on the defensive, but mostly against people like you.;negative
We go on the offensive by converting and teaching people about the word of Christ.;negative
Islam and Christianity can live peacefully.;positive
The problem is that Muslim radicals don't want to talk and they kill and abuse christians all over the world.;negative
Christianity is the most oppressed religion in the world.;positive
Says the atheist who defends himself against what he perceives to be a sharp up-swing in theocratic tendencies and religious fervor.;neutral
Christianity is the most oppressed religion in the world.;positive
Says the American, freely practicing their religion and in no danger of oppression at all.;negative
Christianity is the most oppressed religion.;positive
I thank myself that I can live in a country where I am not oppressed.;negative
But the Chinese, African, and Middle Eastern Christians aren't so lucky.;negative
What is funny is that the Chinese government abuses their Christian population, yet they are the fastest growing church in the world.;positive
Says the Christian defending his faith.;positive
It may be on par with Islam (they oppress other sects of Islam, after all) and Judaism, but it isn't more oppressed than any of the Abrahamic religions.;negative
And the only reason those religions are oppressed is because they all have a tendency to instill themselves as governmental institutions.;negative
So, it's not actually oppression that's occurring, but resistance to assimilation.;negative
What I'm actually saying is active oppression against Christians.;negative
Not the Islamists oppressing each other via government.;negative
Active oppression is killing, raping, and imprisoning Christians based completely on their faith.;negative
Muslims are facing growing oppression the world over, mostly by Christians.;neutral
The oppression you're referring to is most likely religious in-fighting.;negative
By Christians?!;neutral
Please!;neutral
When have Christians been oppressive to Muslims in the last few years?;neutral
Last I saw the Muslims were the ones blowing themselves up and declaring Jihad.;neutral
By a few, I'm going to assume you mean 600-700 years.;negative
So there's that.;neutral
No, I actually mean within the last few years.;neutral
Go back to the turn of the century if you want.;neutral
The crusades were a mistake a long time ago, and the pope got his but kicked for it by Saladin and the Seljuks and the Turks.;negative

Just because he thought they were Muslim.;neutral
Most Christians aren't violent, but neither are the majority of Muslims.;negative
Radical Islam has a stronger and larger presence in modern times, but this isn't a guarantee of lasting Christian peace.;neutral
I'm not seeing any sources to support the author's opinions.;negative
For all I know he could just be ranting.;negative
And if you say most of us Christians are not violent, then why are you blaming us for oppression?;negative
The same reason Christians blame Muslims for their religious violence.;negative
Doesn't feel too nice, does it?;negative
"Christians in this country* are hell-bent on legislating their religious convictions and forcing their beliefs on the entire nation; how is that not oppression?";negative
"Christians in this country bawl every December about their oppression and the ever-lasting ""war on Christmas,"" while the other holidays that occur during that season almost never get mentioned.";negative
Christians may have it bad in some parts of the world, but here they are a thorn in the side of the public.;negative
"Here, they are the oppressors; not the oppressed.";negative
Since Christians have no qualms with painting Islam as a horrible, horrible religion, why should I extend you such a courtesy?;negative
Have your religion and keep your faith, but the moment you start pushing a faith-based social conservative agenda (and I'm not accusing you of such a thing) you become an aggressor.;positive
We are not a thorn in the country.;negative
We are a thorn to you and atheists.;negative
You just can't get along with us, blaming us for oppression on others to justify yourselves.;negative
Frankly I'm tired of it.;negative
Now you're implying atheists are sub-citizens.;neutral
Frankly I'm tired of it.;negative
So are we, and fills my heart with pride to know I'm, if not convincing you, wearing at you.;positive
You just can't get along with us How many people have ever been killed in the name of atheism?;negative
"Can't answer Stalin; political power grab.";negative
Same with Mao.;neutral
The answer?;neutral
Zero.;neutral
I've never physically attacked anyone for their religious beliefs.;negative
In light of these facts, it seems that atheists are much easier to get along with than Christians.;negative
"It's a well known fact that Wade Michael Page was involved in white-supremacy groups who claim that Christians were obligated to preserve a ""pure race.""";neutral
"Judaism and Islam are both entrenched in an endless holy war; care to reconsider?";negative

Despite of the shooting in Connecticut, which is why this subject is in debate, we would be risking more lives.;negative

Simply, if the headmaster of the school in America where the shooting happened had a gun he'd be able to shoot him and end this madness.;neutral

People need the right of defense, safty, a gun.;neutral
People argue that it will just put guns in the wrong hands, but arent they already?;neutral
Really will makeing it Illegal do anything?;negative
I think not, because its not Guns that kills people, its people.;negative
The gun wont kill you without someone behind it, not all people have the right reasons for haveing a gun, but does that mean people who do have the right reasons will be punished and left unarmed, and defensless?;negative
You go to school everyday with the requirement to not bare arms and do you honestly feel defenseless?;neutral
84% of americans havent taken one safety course on guns so its a threat to anyone, behind and infront of the gun.;negative
In alot of gun injuries, the user is harmed too.;negative
Guns should be left in trained haneds and with all the other types of defense methods, guns should not be the defult.;negative
It's not that hard to learn how to use a gun.;negative
I'm 15, and in just 3 hours, when I was 12 years old, I learned how to safely use a rifle, pistol, and shotgun.;negative
Why can we trust the people LIKE US in the military with automatic weapons, tanks, and explosives to defend our own country but we can't trust ourselves to defend our own lives?;negative
I do, however, agree with the fact anyone willing to buy a gun should take some kind of safety course or such, and we should make it a law.;positive
one needs the right of self defense, one needs the right to feel safe in any circumstance.;negative
Yet one also needs to know self restraint, such weapons as a ALL assault weapons should not be allowed, but a hunting rifle and pistols should be allowed.;negative
"With all the other types of self defenise available and the many more being created, i dont think something as barbaric as a good should be the ""fall back defensive.""";negative
do you mean a gun should not be the fall back defensive???;neutral
The gun is a weapon made for the peasents, for those soldiers who couldnt take years to train.;negative
Of all the other weapons in the world the gun is the most efficient for self defense, taking little training and thought to use.;neutral
Are you saying a knife would work better when the majority of Americans dont even know how to use a knife???;neutral
They would end up cutting themselves let alone their assaulters.;neutral

Even if a background check is preformed and comes out clean, most americans have no history of gun safety.;negative
"Also, though americans may be ""law abiding"" they still are animals and have natural reactions, there is NO human alive that hasnt been startled before or scared.";positive
Its those feelings that provoke gun use as a defense in the first place.;positive
If you want defense against intruders, try a home alarm system, a loud barking dog will even warn you without killing someone.;negative
If you want to stop someone, use another form of defense like a taser.;negative
Some people may say, but what if they have a gun?;neutral
If there was gun control, that couldnt be the case, yes there will always be violent people, but without guns there would be less dead people.;negative
At school no one has a gun, its just how it is, and in the cases where one was entered into the environment, there was a set plan to stay safe and the deaths are obviously lower from that event, then they would be if guns were aloud daily.;negative
Guns make room for emotional mistakes and kill the need for restraint.;negative
I do think gun control will help this country and i am not mistaken.;neutral
If criminals keep their guns, they wont be able to use them.;positive
Why?;negative
People if no one had a gun in an area and one single shot was heard, the whole area would be on alert for that one shot and the gun would get confiscated.;neutral
In countries like great britan where there is strict gun control, this happens all the time.;negative
If we just assume its useless cause we have some criminals and just have to bare arms to balance it out then its just twice as dangerous, two lefts don't make a right.;negative
"Anyone that is considered a ""criminal"" is on record by the US government and will be searched before the citizens for that reason.";positive
The government is smart enough to realize that criminals would have guns, its not something thats just overlooked.;negative
I think that people should be able to have guns because they might need them to protect themselves if they live in a bad neighborhood and it is in the bill of rights.;negative
The bill of rights does not state the an individual citizen has their own right to have their own gun, id read up on that before making that statement.;negative
People who live in a bad neighbor hood can move, or live in a protected shelter if moving is not an option.;negative
People who consider a neighborhood unsafe often think so because of guns.;neutral
"I myself often think ""someones gonna come out and shoot me"" when walking through bad neighborhoods.";negative
If citizens didn't have guns, that would make everyone feel that much safer.;negative
In unsafe neighborhoods, there would be one less worry of not getting hurt by some irresponsible citizen with a gun.;negative
Even if guns were banned, things wouldn't really be much safer.;negative
The people committing gun crimes are usually not getting them legitimately in the first place.;negative
"People cannot be expected to ""move"" every time they perceive a potential threat.";neutral
Banning guns is not the answer.;negative
i think if people are responsible they should be able to buy and use firarms.;neutral
"but theres some people who use them for the wrong reason and that is what makes little familys cry because there loved one was gunned down by a horable person ;(((((((((((";negative
"Your side sounds more ""against gun control"".";neutral
Responsible people, in my opinion, are the ones who have been trained and are armed with guns under government authorization.;negative
Which is quite rarely an average american citizen.;negative
"You state, ""but theres some people who use them for the wrong reason and that is what makes little familys cry because there loved one was gunned down by a horable person ;((((((((((("".";negative
"That quote is much more for the ""against side"" and hurts your arugment";negative
Right to bear arms- second amendment of the constitution.;neutral
weapons are used for many reasons these days.;neutral
some use weapons for sport some use them for looks some use them for fun.;negative
although some people have killed people with guns also we shouldnt take our constitutional rights away do to a few mentally psychotic or duranged people;negative
First of all its not in the constitution itself, its simply an amendment, i think you should read about what your talking about before you go and time up and argument on it.;neutral
Here is the a the direct quote;neutral
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.;positive
In oder for the state to be secure we cannot have deadly weapons used for looks like they are some new type of hot wheels made for fun and looks.;negative
Your constitutional right is to keep and bare arms, not guns, and for the safety of the state and all in it we need to take away simple dangers for citizens, cause eventually we need to stop playing with hot wheels and grow up.;negative
people have rights.;neutral
this is a free country.;neutral
we have the right to defend ourselves, but guns should come with a rule book.;neutral
just my oppinion tho.;negative
Guns dont need a rule book, people need to be trained in what they are using and most citizen have never taken a gun safety course.;negative
People do have rights but they should not have the right to end someones life because they were scared the MIGHT loose their own, and thats the self defense argument.;negative
If you wanna feel safe there are so many less barbaric and deadly options then a gun.;negative
We are humans, not deer.;negative
If you pepper spray and tase an intruder, what more can they do?;negative
They cant see or move...so they cant shoot you and they are still alive.;positive
We do have a free country, we should make it safe too.;negative
Brad, just because the Criminals may be more prepared and we might not have the time to grab our gun that doesnt mean that guns shouldnt be alowed, all your saying is based on circumstances, and luck;negative
This comment should be under brads statement, but to dispute.;negative
Timing may just be a statement but the guns are still the main focus.;neutral
Guns shouldnt be allow because the defenders want to shoot just as much as the intruders.;neutral
I think i covered this in more detail when i explained the pros of having citizens being gun free.;neutral
"Even ""If criminals keep their guns"",(if we were to confiscate all guns) "" they wont be able to use them.";negative
If no one had a gun in an area and one single shot was heard, the whole area would be on alert for that one shot and the gun would get confiscated.;negative
In countries like great britan where there is strict gun control, this happens all the time.;negative
If we just assume its useless cause we have some criminals and just have to bare arms to balance it out then its just twice as dangerous, two lefts don't make a right.;negative
"Anyone that is considered a ""criminal"" is on record by the US government and will be searched before the citizens for that reason.";positive
"The government is smart enough to realize that criminals would have guns, its not something thats just overlooked.""";negative
People should have the right to bear arms.;neutral
If guns were to be banned, people would still have them in their homes and on the streets.;negative
Its just how things work.;neutral
Some people say that taking away the right to bear arms will decrease crime rate, but when the righs is taken away, more damage will be done due to lack of self defense.;negative
We dont want that !;neutral
I feel like im repeating myself.;negative
But to simplify what ive been saying, if the government had gun control they would start out with the high risk people such as criminals and work their way down.;negative
Not having guns would be an overall safer environment.;negative
A common environment like this is school.;neutral
"Some people argue that there are still school shootings and this is true and also related to your idea of ""its just how things work.""";neutral
While their are school shooting they are vary rare, just like america would be if we didnt have guns.;negative
Schools also are prepared, remember doing those lock down drills?;negative
Our country would prepare us the same way.;negative
School shootings cause far less deaths then if schools were aloud on a daily bases to everyone (like america now).;negative
We should leave guns to the professionals and if we need to feel safe, we should protect ourselves without killing someone else.;negative
"The statement of ""Guns kill people, Guns kill children"" is false guns dont kill people, people kill people.Guns should be aloud everywere GUNS ARE GOOD.";negative
"This comment should be under the comment instead of on the ""arguments for"" side.";negative
This side is for your individual comments, as to debate with you, guns should not be aloud in the hands of citizens because it is the gun that kills the people, the person.;negative
If the person was responsible, you could take the gun out of the situation and someone would still die, this is not true.;negative
The gun is what is directly taking the human life.;positive
"To say that quote is false is just commonly statisticly untrue, as stated in my argument Against; ""For example, during a year when over 5,000 teens and children died from gun wounds in the USA, in Great Britain, where gun ownership is very restricted, 19 teens and children died from gun wounds.""";negative
I posted this on a similar debate and i believe it clearly shows my views:;positive
I agree that one should have the right to own arms but i do not believe on has to use violence to obtain their wildest gun dreams.;neutral
if one wants to own a gun i have no qualms with them but if they wish to own guns such as a AK47 and AK74u they should be dealt with in a more civilized manner to protect the people.;negative
A hunting rifle is fine, a pistol is fine, an automatic or assault rifle is over doing it specially since the only reason an American needs a gun such as a rifle is for hunting.;negative
I am not saying all guns are for hunting a pistol may be used for self defense, But only as a Deterrence to violence.;negative
Although its not your idea, i think its still well formed.;neutral
My dispute is that hunting and other recreational guns should be stored safely in the place where the recreation is taking place.;negative
For example, hunting guns should be stored under lock and key at those hunting grounds, then checked out and returned as not to take them home cause harm to non-deer life like humans.;negative
As for the topic of self defense, guns should not be used as a common self defense.;negative
Why?;negative
Lets use a simple example, your walking home in the dark its quite and you think someones following you so have your hand on the gun and keep walking, looking back.;negative
Suddenly a car pulls in front of you, startled you naturally turn around and shoot.;negative
Theirs no one behind you, but an innocent dead driver in front of you.;negative
"Its simple ""accidents"" like these account for most deaths.";negative
Having something less likely to kill a person, such as a taser, is much safer.;negative
Some people may argue that it doesnt do enough damage to defend somone, but taserd stop your muscles from moving, stopping whoever right in their tracks, alive.;positive
We should stop using guns for defense like we do, nothing that deadly should be so self conscious.;negative
Guns rights is in a pretty good position right now.;positive
You can own a gun, if proven trustworthy.;neutral
This is not the case in all states, but it is in most.;neutral
Some argue that it is dangerous to be giving out guns, but with guns-rights or no gun-rights criminals will still have guns.;negative
However, the average person who wants to own a gun for self-defense will be prohibited to without guns-rights.;neutral
Meanwhile, with gun-rights the average person can own a gun AND protect himself against criminals.;negative
Although I'm against guns, what you are saying is absolutely correct.As far as Americas majority of people who do want gun rights, they are in a pretty good position.As i said in my first argument, my husband is all for guns and is one of those affected by Australia's recent gun laws.;positive
"My hubby ""wishes he had your gun rights America, so be grateful""....Personally i think its the reason behind half your problems... however my hubby,(in this moment i am typing) just rebutted me by saying that in Switzerland, they encourage, that all their citizens have a gun.";negative
We have to look outside the box.;neutral
Criminals WILL ABSOLUTLEY get a hold of guns whether there is a law banning firearms or not.;negative
If you don't believe in guns, then don't buy a damn gun.;negative
If you feel safe in your home without a gun, then don't buy a damn gun.;negative
If you feel safe walking amongst thieves and murderers with just a can of pepper spray, then....say it with it me.....Don't buy a damn gun.;negative
Me?;neutral
I like the idea that if I have the CHOICE, I could LETHALLY defend me or a loved one.;negative
I don't know about you, but I live outside the box.;neutral
On the outside we don't live in a perfect world where there isn't crime and violence.;negative
I'm not a trigger happy fellow either as you might paint us gun rights enthusiasts.;negative
I dread the thought of the day I might have to take the life of another human being.;negative
You know what though?;neutral
.....It could be mine that's taken from me if I fail to protect myself.;negative
If everyone carried a firearm on them, everywhere they went.....;negative
you think Home Invasions, Theft or Murders would occur quite as often?;neutral
I don't believe so.;negative
Half the scum bags would be dead.;negative
Take away our weapons....;neutral
and you give criminals the chance to flourish.;positive
the general public should be able to posses guns for self defense and safety.;positive
i agree that there should be some restrictions like if you are a convicted felon you are not aloud to posses a gun.;negative
but a citizen trying to protect himself should be able to have a gun.;negative
some may say that crime happens because of guns.;neutral
guns don't kill people, people do.;neutral
but even if guns were outlawed the criminals would find illegal guns and would find other ways to harm people.;negative
all people shouldn't have they're safety taken away just because of what criminals decide to do with the guns.;negative
guns have no purpose other then killing.;negative
i do not think all guns should be banned, but definitely some.;neutral
if you like to hunt, then go out and buy a hunting rifle.;negative
however i believe guns such as AK-47's serve no purpose.;negative
they are machine guns, and you do not need a machine gun to hunt a deer.;negative
as for self defense, well there are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for defense.;positive
you could move to a place with a lower crime rate.;negative
buy a taser or pepper spray.;neutral
get an alarm or guard dog.;neutral
besides, what would you need a gun for to defend yourself?;neutral
if it is against a robber then i should let you know that most robberies occur when you are away from home, making the gun pointless.;negative
Guns serve a useful purpose in self defense because they reduce the amount of money and strain on the court system to imprison the offender.;negative
Dead people can't waste government resources.;negative
"The about 80% of the ""general public"" dont even know a thing about gun safety.";neutral
Although i agree that criminals should not possess guns, at least most of them know how to use it.;negative
Citizens trying to protect themselves should use something that wont kill people with a flick of a finger.;negative
Pepper spray can blind, tasers will stop someone wherever they stand, guns click and kill.;negative
I said this in jacobs dispute, but if people were the ones killing people then it wouldnt matter if there was a gun involved.;negative
Umm heres a visual;neutral
Person+Gun= -Person;negative
(A person with a gun kills a person);negative
Take out the gun cause your saying its not its fault...;neutral
Person=-Person;neutral
If the gun wasnt responsible, and its the persons fault, then it wouldnt matter if the gun was there or not.;negative
But infact it makes quite the difference.;positive
Your point about criminals finding illegal guns is just like illegal guns, something just cant be completely erased.;negative
But saying outlawing them would make gun rate increase cause they are illegal makes no logical sense.;negative
Take a place like school, we have no guns here, and in cases where shootings happen, its much less then i would be if people had guns everyday.;negative
Same goes for a biggerscale like the USA.;negative
We also have all been trained with the lock down drill, and im certain the government would issue something like that as well.;negative
"The people behind the guns ""defending"" themselves are just as trigger happy as any intruder.";positive
To just say guns should be aloud because criminals have them, is childish and we need to age past barbaric murder caused by guns.;negative
"ohhhhhblooodyhell, Hours later me and me hubby are still debating this and its really starting to shit me....he is really starting to change my mind... someone please gimme a gun...;)";negative
I bet the people against guns are for the killing of babies...;neutral
ya brad if the people that the robbers were gonna take hostage have guns they can show them whats up;neutral
"This comment should be under brads comment instead of on the ""arguments for"" side.";negative
"I think that the statement of ""Guns kill people.";neutral
"Guns kill children"" is totally true.";positive
But people try and tell you that its the person that uses the gun to kill that people and the children or they could have a mental disease that makes them do it and then later they don't understand what they did.;negative
Wrong.;neutral
I think that if somebody is mental, they should even get a gun.;negative
I feel that only police and other people in that group of upper class people like that should be the only ones with guns and weapons like that.;negative
Well what about the defense of people?;neutral
What if you get robbed and he has a weapon (not a gun) and you have nothing to defend yourself because of this law.;negative
Well that sucks (: No with less guns getting robbed shouldn't be a big deal... Use a frying pan or something to protect yourself or better yet call the cops.;negative
But guns do kill people and children, yes it is fair that police and upper class or that enforcement get guns (they need them and use them for a purpose).;negative
THE RIGHTS FOR GUN SHOULD BE LIMITED FOR THE PEOPLE THAT USE THEM FOR THE BAD REASONS AND GIVE THEM TO THE PEOPLE THAT USE THEM FOR GOOD REASONS TO HELP AND SAVE PEOPLES LIVES (:;negative
Guns are bad period.;negative
"Dont assume that ""the upperclass"" are any less capable of using them in a corrupted fashion.Remember human nature is human nature.";negative
No-one is exempt from human nature.Time has proved again and again Anyone is capable of snapping.;negative
We should protect gun laws because of crazy people who go out of control with them and guns these days are getting more advanced and easier to get;negative
That person does not look crazy at all, he appears to be a person who happens to like guns and is responsible enough to go to a shooting range.;negative
By taking away guns from the average citizen you are only allowing the criminals easy access seeing as they will not give up their guns.;negative
People abuse gun rights to rob places and take hostages.;negative
people say that you need guns to protect yourself but do you really have time to find your gun if you are taken hostage.;neutral
usualy the people commiting the crime are more prepared and ready to strike;negative
Psst, criminals don't plan on following gun laws, so banning guns will not prevent robberies or crimes.;negative
"if you need to take the ""time to find your gun if you are taken hostage"" i surely hope you do not have a gun and more importantly have anyone who would do something bad if they found it.";neutral
Student News Daily offers lots of policial stamensts about popular topic today.;positive
"In a chart compairing Conservitive and Liberal views, there was the following quote; ""The Second Amendment gives no individual the right to own a gun, but allows the state to keep a militia (National Guard).";negative
Guns kill people.;neutral
"Guns kill children.""";neutral
For example, during a year when over 5,000 teens and children died from gun wounds in the USA, in Great Britain, where gun ownership is very restricted, 19 teens and children died from gun wounds.;negative
This is very blunt statistic proof that states that gun control thats rectricted to certian personal keep citizens safe and reduces the death by guns.;negative
With society and technology proggressing at such a fast speed, the need for barbaric uses of protections such as guns is not nessicary.;negative
Guns can be unpredictable and almost 84% of americans have not been trained in gun safety.;negative
With the uses of modern day technoloy for individual protection, gun control should only be restriced to select forces of the goverment who are trained in using these weapons.;negative
A huge part of american culture is film, and if you were to ask people if violence and special effects involiving guns and other firing weapons were nessicary to a good film, one out of two would say yes.;positive
"This point gets even more drastic then a 50/50 when i comes to videos games, once you past rated ""E"" there it is almost impossible to find a game with no use of guns.";negative
"Taking gun use as a ""game"" only provokes the wrong use of these weapons and teaches the brian that guns can be an ""easy way or"" or a ""simple defense"".";negative
Not only do adults play games, so do children.;neutral
My 11 year old brother is a avid player of the new first person shooter Modern Warfare2.;positive
This game is fast paced and above all violent, take a look in the video below.;positive
Modern Warefare may ahve the rating M but its very common for children to play these games.;negative
"Some may argue that these ""train to be future military member"" but how does jamming down the ""x"" button until 2 in the moring make you a good soilder in training?";negative
Simple anwser, it doesn't.;negative
We cannot have guns in the same enviorment as play.;negative
Teaching people that firing a gun gives you points is not what they should know.;negative
Firing that gun kills another human being and will haunt you for the rest of your life.;negative
Infact you may have heard about how many soilders who come back from the war suffer from many phycological issues that in many cases cannot be completely cured.;neutral
We should leave the guns to the people who need to use them.;negative
We as citizens need to be protected, not be armed.;negative
To keep the country both mentally and physically safe, we need to keep reality and virtual gaming seperate to keep are country togather.;negative
We need to restrict gun control.;negative
Can you please give me a link to where you found your statistics?;positive
They are so interesting I somewhat doubt them (no offense.);negative
By the way, Modern Warfare 2 teaches tactics.;negative
I think that we should all have the right to own a gun because most people use then for protection or hunting so we should and people that dont use then for that reason might just have then to just have then;neutral
"""Guns are needed for self defense.""";neutral

Associated Press;neutral
"""Right now everything points to a tragic accident,"" Police Chief Kevin Brunelle told The Associated Press, adding investigators were awaiting forensic results.";negative
John Tabutt, 62, told investigators he got his gun when he thought he heard an intruder, then fired at a figure in the hallway, according to Brunelle.;negative
It was Tabutt's live-in fiancee, 62-year-old Nancy Dinsmore, who family members say he was going to marry Saturday.;negative
"Tabutt told authorities he thought she was next to him in bed the whole time.""";neutral

At this time please click the link at the bottom of this page and view the news video of the tragic 911 call.;negative
If you dont want to view the video, dont bother reading this.;negative

Its traumatic accidents like that, that prove why using guns for defense, is dangerous no matter what.;negative
"If that man had just tased the ""intruder"" they could still be alive and happily married.";neutral
Some people may call this a one time accident, but people think of guns almost by default as necessary to self-defense.;negative
"Infact all of the people ""for"" gun-rights used that idea and phrased it as the only way.";negative
But in no way is something as deadly as that gun, the only way.;negative
Our school is a gun free environment, or better phrased, has gun control.;negative
Do students feel safe?;neutral
Yes, because guns are not allowed so the fear of being shot is alot less.;negative
Could a gun be entered into a school?;neutral
Yes but if it was fired, we have designated lockdown drills we have practiced and one schools shooting kills lots less then if we were to have guns everyday.;negative
Think of america as an environment with guns available everyday.;neutral
Imagine how many lives would be taken due to anger or other temporary emotional disabilities.;neutral
We cant keep amusing the worst of everyone around us.;negative
"""They have guns, so we need guns as well to protect ourselves.""";neutral
Two wrongs like in that statement do not make a right.;negative
"If everyone had gun control, wed have a ""school"" type of environment and while ""schools shootings"" or gun use in a gun-controlled setting would still occur, its much, much less then if we were all having guns on ourselves as ""Defense"".";negative
We have come to a time when technology and idealisms are advancing, so should our policy on gun control.;negative
Self defense should just keep one safe, not kill off other humans.;negative
Innocent ones like a wife to be, or a robber who is just down on his luck.;negative
They are fellow humans, we shouldn't even get the change to flick and finger and fire a bullet at them.;negative
Especially when something as common as pepper spray and your pet rottweiler could keep you safer.;negative
So your argument against people owning guns is that since some people might make stupid mistakes then it is okay to punish everyone?;negative
With that logic we might as well ban cars because some people will get in wrecks from being bad drivers, ban alcohol because some people drink too much, and ban kitchen utensils because some people stab themselves.;negative
This is a high school debate, for a history class, anyone not in it like yourself is banned and anyone else floating in here and reading this don't bother typing you are not a high school student and need to find something else to busy yourself with that interrupting out education activity.;negative

If I am strapped for cash and decide that the only way to make any money would be to rob somebody, I think I'd rather rob a store without a gun than a store with a gun.;negative
They can be used for bad things, but legal guns are typically used for good or for protection from illegal guns.;negative
ok then.;neutral
So do cars, trains, boats, planes, stoves, showers, bathtubs, ....uh wait a sec...did you mean that people can use guns to kill people?;negative
My bad!;neutral
Edit: Sorry, I just seen the Note on this debate.;negative
I'm not part of the class you speak of.;negative
I understand if you wish to delete this response.;negative
This was a hard one for me.;negative

Guns are very easy to get and anyone can use them to kill people.;positive
people kill people, but guns make it a heck of a lot easier.;neutral
i do not think all guns should be banned, but some should.;neutral
if you like to hunt, and you want to kill a deer, then go out and by a hunting rifle.;negative
however, certain guns are overkill such as AK-47's.;negative
i do not think you need a machine gun to kill a deer.;neutral
you may say that guns could be used for personal protection, however i think buying a gun for that reason is stupid and paranoid because there are so many other things you can do before resorting to a gun for protection.;negative
you could move to a place with a lower crime rate, or by a taser/ pepper spray.;negative
you could get a guard dog, but the main idea is that there is little purpose for guns other than their use for killing, and that is why i am against gun rights.;negative
Should people be allowed to own handguns?;negative
Well, owning handguns for personal home protection is different that carrying guns in a concealed fashion for protection.;negative
I agree with the concept of letting everyone own guns for their protection at home...I am not so sure about conceal uses.;negative
http://www.nraila.org/issues/FactSheets/ Read.aspx?ID=120;neutral
Education reduces accidents perhaps we should teach gun safety in public schools instead of making it illegal for everyone thus ensuring only criminals and government has them.;negative
Why in the world would people NOT be allowed to own handguns?;negative
"Every living thing on the planet has the right to defend itself; humans, lacking pointy teeth, horns, or claws, use tools to provide for their defense.";negative
Handguns are one of the primary tools used in that pursuit.;neutral
"Yes people should, but seeing as I live in a shitty little country known as Australia I don't get most of the rights other western countries in the world do (""best country in the world"" my ass).";neutral
I think guns it is a thing like fishing tackle and in right hands is not dangerous one, that is why to allow to own the guns is normal nowadays.;negative
for example, many people have habit of hunting as a hobby or keeping weapon for self - protection.;negative
I believe that people should have the right to own a gun.;positive
But, prospective hand gun owners and anyone that has the desire to have a Concealed Weapons Permit should take safety and ethics classes.;negative
Plus, certain rules should be in place.;negative
If you have been hospitalized for a mental illness, then the prospect should wait for 2 years to purchase a handgun or a semi-automatic assault rifle like the AR-15.;negative
That is the law in my state.;neutral
But, yes.;neutral
I do believe that people should be allowed to own guns;negative
Yes, but if abused should immediatly be restricted.;negative
Like death threats, hunting too close to homes, or a history of crimal acts.;negative
yeah...i think if is possible it would be better to own handguns, because there are so many accidents!!;neutral
handguns will be the tool of own secure!!;neutral
but also it is dangerous for owner, because he can injure someone;negative
I don't think that people should be allowed to own handguns, not all people.;negative
Guns aren't toys, you can injure someone even if you don't want.;negative
There are many accidents when people was injured.;neutral
Also it is dangerous because some people can't control their emotions and no one knows what might happen if they had a handgun when they are in anger.;negative
I don't think that all people should have guns.;neutral
It is admittedly to have them for policy and that is enough.;positive
If everyone have guns there would be just mess in the world!;negative
I dissagree with you because you know that it would be better to people to have a gun because they can protect their selves.;negative
but there are some cases when people cannot control themselves and they kill or hurt people by guns and later they blame themselves about what they have done and they pay for this mistake by their life in prison.;negative
I should let you know right from the start that handguns are used for protection against criminals in America nearly 2 million times per year.;negative
That's up to five times more often than they're used to commit crimes and nearly 128 times the total number of murders in the United States;negative
but if people have no guns then nothing like crime would happen, nobody would be murdered and the number of deaths would be decreased.;negative
Just imagine that everyone has guns and then why we need in policy?;negative
They will not have a force under criminals.;negative
If person drink alcohol then he will lose his control and if someone annoy him then he will just in shot him and he would be died.;negative
Everyone has rights on live.;positive
but if people have no guns then nothing like crime would happen, nobody would be murdered and the number of deaths would be decreased.;negative
Just imagine that everyone has guns and then why we need in policy?;negative
They will not have a force under criminals.;negative
If person drink alcohol then he will lose his control and if someone annoy him then he will just in shot him and he would be died.;negative
Everyone has rights on life.;positive
Ok you think that gun is the most important reason of criminals... However, without gun people would kill or do criminal without gun thay would kill by knife or they would create something may be worse than gun, and now we are tolking about gun is right.;negative
Yes because people who use guns to defend themselves are less likely to be attacked or injured than people who use other methods of protection or don't defend themselves at all.;negative
yes you are right.;positive
guns are the main reason of crime.;neutral
according to statistics there is increasing number of people who have guns and today we see increasing level of crime.;negative
In addition people who have guns can hurt not only the person who hurt them but also other people who were near this action.;neutral
I think that guns should be used by policy and it is their work to find criminals.;neutral
yes you seid that guns should be used by policy and it means that gus is rights.;positive
Also if policy would use guns it will make less criminal because people will afraid policy with guns.;negative
you get my idea.;neutral
It is policy's work to find out criminals and if it is need to use guns for catching them.;negative
If everyone use guns then policy will lose their force.;neutral
moreover people will be able to use guns anytime they, it means that people will live in fear that in any time in any place someone can kill them;positive
You know that it is too late to speak about what would people do if guns hadn't created because guns have already created and entire the world people use guns for many reasons and you know that with guns people can not protect their selves without kiling somebody.;negative
Also with guns people feel their selves more comfortable and they sure that if somebody try to kill or beat them thay can shoot with guns in air or in leg and criminals would run away.;negative
guns have already created, but they are not for everybody.;negative
they are only for people who have rights to have guns such as policy.;neutral
They have learnt about how to use it or when to use and they could control themselves.;neutral
according to simple people not everyone is able to use it and because of little mistake they can shoot another person.;negative
people will suffer due to not their fault.;negative
Of course not every person is able to buy or take gun, that is why before buing guns people have to show their license, only after that people will be able to buy guns.;negative
It means that only normal people can buy guns.;neutral
All people know that their crime is punished.;neutral
However, policy use every time guns, can you immagine that policy try to stop criminalswithout gun.;negative
but i am for policy using guns.;neutral
for them it is ok.;neutral
furthermore, there is a corruption that can allow every person to buy license.;negative
anyway allowing everyone to use guns is terrible and unadmittable.;negative
everyone will live in fear that someone can kill them and the level of deaths will be increased.;neutral
i don't think that allowing guns for everyone is not the best way of protecting yourself.;neutral
The gun violence in the United States is atrocious.;negative
Guns should be banned.;neutral
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral

If it's easy for everyone to own guns/handguns/whatever that can shoot, then so are the robbers/bad guys.;negative
gun ownership will only increase the number of robbery/crime.;neutral
besides, it's gonna be very dangerous if children touch/use it coz their parents don't take care of the guns nicely.;negative
they could kill their selves or anyone near 'em.;neutral
there are already a lot of accidents occur coz of guns.;negative
You think gun ownership will increase the crime rate?;neutral
Who do you think is more likely to commit a crime:;neutral
"Person A who legally bought a gun; registered gun owner with all information they are legally bound to keep truthful, with a criminal history check.";positive
Person B who got a gun illegally, by the black market.;negative
It makes it tougher for criminals to commit crimes with legal ownership because their chances of being identified and caught is almost guaranteed.;negative
As for children having easier access to guns, that is the parents/adults responsibility to teach their children about gun safety and to keep guns in a place out of their reach.;negative
Should we take away matches and lighters because adults are so careless with those around children as well?;negative
No it calls for parenting.;negative
You know, actually teaching a child something?;neutral
Just want to see why people want more gun legislation.;negative
It seems most people have this fantasy about shooting somebody breaking into their house in the middle of the night.;negative
Statistically, it's far more likely that they or a member of their family, especially their own children will die as a result of there being a gun in the home, not some street hood intruding on their castle.;negative
"The classic argument is that ""Criminals don't care about gun bans, so a gun ban only takes guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens"".";negative
I believe I read not long ago that there are close to 300 million legally owned firearms in the United States.;negative
With a house full of guns on every corner, where do you think criminals get them from?;neutral
So people shouldn't have the capacity to defend themselves?;negative
Well, as a child raised by ex-criminals on both sides of my family I can tell you that we would never purchase guns from the store or pawn shops.;negative
The best way to acquire guns is via yard sales, or have a person buy the gun for you, that way your name doesn't show on the paper work.;negative
Seriously, who is stupid enough to follow gun regulations at face value and get their name attached to a model of firearm?;negative
That's just asking for trouble.;negative
Did I mention black market arms dealers?;neutral
They aren't THAT hard to find.;negative
Also, why in god's name would you steal a gun from an armed house?;negative
That's the riskiest thing to do, because you need to know where it's hidden and you always risk being caught in the process by the armed owner.;negative
With a gun?;neutral
No.;neutral
I see, so banning guns just stops law abiding citizens from having them, yet your family of criminals buys them from people who legally obtained them, or has them legally obtained for them.;negative
That makes sense.;neutral
Why?;negative
I don't know, ask some of the people who stole 1.7 million guns between 1993 and 2002.;negative
Is it really that difficult to case a house for a couple days and figure out when somebody's at work?;negative
I don't even come from a family of criminals and I'm sure I'd have no problem doing this.;negative
Because...?;neutral
It's scary to you?;neutral
Laws change through the years, but stockpiles of firearms are decades old.;negative
You buy what existed before the laws came into effect.;neutral
It's obvious stuff.;negative
Of course, you can still believe that banning guns or imposing stiff regulations on them will make them vanish, if that makes you happy or comfortable.;positive
It's not true, however.;negative
So less than 1% of your 300 million firearms are stolen, this must be the primary way to obtain illegal firearms.;negative
It's just not really a bright idea to use this method when yard sales are safer and won't get you spotted by neighbors.;negative
Yeah, I KNOW you can figure out when the guy leaves his house, but why spend days figuring out someone's patterns of behaviour when you can have someone buy a gun at a store for you, or pick one up anonymously at a yard sale?;negative
That's true, but what people aren't told is that the number of deaths are just below 50.;negative
Criminals don't care about gun bans, so a gun ban only takes guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens.;negative
"""I believe I read not long ago that there are close to 300 million legally owned firearms in the United States.";negative
With a house full of guns on every corner, where do you think criminals get them from?;neutral
80% of all deaths from firearms are from illegally bought guns, either smuggled in from another state or over the boarder from Mexico (in the US anyway).;negative
Every single massacre has been in a gun controlled area.;negative
Columbine, Albertville, Virginia, whereas not a single one has been in places where citizens have been allowed to carry guns.;negative
A natural response would be more gun regulation is going to help, but people need to look at the facts rather than just ideology.;negative
Think about it: if you were a madman and you wanted to kill as many people as possible, would you rather go to a gun-free area or an area where most people are carrying guns.;negative
Gun regulation is based upon the misled knowledge that if you give a gun to the average person, they will go about trying to kill as many people as possible, but in actual fact the average person is relatively good and sane enough not to do that.;positive
The government can stop law abiding citizens from protecting themselves, but they can never prevent criminals from doing so.;negative
What really kills, the gun or the person carrying it?;negative
What are you saying?;neutral
That people desire to kill a burglar, or that people desire to protect their family?;neutral
So that means that people oughtn't have the right to protect themselves when a break-in does occur?;neutral
But it can happen.;neutral
A large portion of the people I know have been robbed.;negative
What is wrong with this argument?;neutral
And if those 300,000,000 guns were taken away, what would come of the millions of illegally owned firearms?;negative
That's quite the exaggeration;negative
Many places.;neutral
Strict gun control is needed.;negative
It is now 2015 and gun violence continues to grow.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral

I don't have an issue with hunting rifles (300, 306 etc) , even handguns are probably ok.;negative
My question is why would anybody need to own an M-16 or an AK-47?;negative
I was at a gun shop last week that had an assault rifle on sale with a fucking gernade launcher attached to it.;negative
"""Well, you can't buy the gernades legally.""";negative
Then why the fuck is it on there?;neutral
I'm pretty sure when our forefathers wrote the right to bear arms in the constitution they weren't envisioning the assualt rifle.;neutral
Many people feel this way.;neutral
Simple answer, really.;negative
Fun.;positive
Why did I build a flamethrower when I was a kid in school?;negative
Why do young boys make pipe bombs and enjoy firecrackers?;negative
It's fun.;positive
Lighting things on fire and blowing stuff up is fun, and having powerful guns is especially so.;positive
Because some of us are drawn to big weapons and would like to see one, and on the down low you can make grenades or buy them and launch them in no-man's land.;negative
What ever happened to just accepting that some of us like to shoot things, blow things up, etc?;negative
It's good, clean fun and nobody is hurt from it.;positive
Culture of fear maybe?;negative
What does fund matter when safety is involved?;neutral
How did you do it, pray tell!;positive
"I don't know; I never did.";negative
However, I'd be interested in knowing how to do so.;neutral
Both of which are extremely dangerous, however.;negative
If you are arguing that the danger/power is fun, I could say the same thing for rape or murder, depending on the person.;negative
They are aesthetically pleasant.;positive
How many people actually know how to make them?;neutral
Some of us?;neutral
Are you saying that you are like this?;neutral
If so, this is a side of you I've never seen: the human side.;positive
Mainly since the '90s.;neutral
I'd say somewhere around the mid-90s: Amber Hagerman, JonBenet Ramsey - the media paid too much attention to these child-murders and people came to accept them as normal.;negative
It failed due to the fuel not being volatile enough.;negative
My parents wouldn't let me manufacture anything more volatile.;negative
We had many arguments over these kinds of things, because I was always either planning to create dangerous chemicals, or was on the verge of killing myself by creating dangerous things in the name of curiosity and experimentation.;negative
In hindsight I was fortunate to have them watching over me.;negative
It's all pretty easy to figure out on your own, though.;positive
Maybe, but they hurt a non-consenting party.;neutral
Again, not very hard to figure out.;negative
Don't kid yourself.;neutral
Yeah.;neutral
It really made child abduction and murder so much more difficult to accomplish.;negative
Parents!;neutral
Always holding their prodigies back!;negative
My curiosity was found in books.;neutral
In hindsight, I`d say I was much better off.;negative
As can those types of weapons.;neutral
A flamethrower - however powerful it was - if used in the right location, could cause anything from mild damage to a forest fire.;neutral
No.;neutral
It is still extremely rare.;positive
It has always been rare.;positive
Children, in Britain at least, are - I think the number was fifty times - more likely to die inside the house than outside.;negative
Child abduction is still nearly unheard of.;negative
Most cases of missing children, the child is a runaway.;negative
Family abduction accounts for most of the abduction cases.;negative
A couple thousand are abducted by strangers each year.;positive
How many children are in the country?;neutral
60,000,000+.;neutral
They don't have much to fear.;negative
Also, they`d be safer if more of them played outside.;negative
Who is going to abduct a child in the midst of twenty or thirty+ friends?;neutral
You have no idea.;negative
I wanted to make a plasma cannon but no one would help me with the necessary components.;negative
Plus I kept designing bombs.;negative
I was a troubled child, obviously.;negative
Oh, I read too, entirely non-fiction.;negative
It took a lot of persuasion for me to finally start reading fiction.;neutral
It didn't help that my interests gave me acid burns and powder burns.;negative
Try explaining that to the ER: your child has burnt hands from black powder flashback.;neutral
Yeah, you were better off not looking into these things.;negative
Most technologies we take for granted are as destructive, but we allow them.;neutral
We should be able to enjoy these weapons.;positive
"I was being sarcastic, like ""Drat!";negative
"Now we can't abduct children anymore to test our latest smallpox vaccine.""";neutral
Dumb humanoids.;neutral
All children are trouble.;negative
Mostly non-fiction.;neutral
I enjoyed the occasional fiction tale - modern, that is - however, I found them dreadfully difficult to complete.;positive
Precisely my argument against cars.;neutral
There is a difference, however: the only purpose for weapons is to - you're smart enough to figure this one out, aren't you - whereas, say, vehicles - whilst they can do grievous damage - also have benefits.;negative
Well, you've always got 9disabled children to test it on.];negative
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willowbrook_State_School);neutral
I just lacked interest.;negative
I thank my teachers however for pressuring me into fiction because it opened my mind to many great authors.;positive
Cars have utilities and disadvantages.;neutral
Flamethrowers too, though the list of utilities is shorter.;negative
They aren't only for killing.;negative
Hey quick question for you...why were these weapons made?;negative
They were made for the government, the same government that wants to take them away.;negative
P.S. I have many guns and as I stated before the only time have pulled the trigger on any gun for violence was for the government.;negative
You folks that think your political party can be trusted are sadly mistaken.;negative
Many reasons.;neutral
The answers range from war to genocide to hunting to law enforcement to self protection.;negative
That's not their only purpose and it's not that simple.;negative
I often wonder how one can live with themselves after turning a gun upon someone else.;positive
You're mistaken if you think this comment applies to me.;neutral
No because they didn't actually exist at the time.;neutral
But the reason for the second amendment is so that we will be able to protect ourselves from the government if we need to.;positive
If guns such as M-16's and AK-47's are restricted to government use, then who's more powerful?;negative
The people or the government?;neutral
The fact that someone has a gun is not the point of the second amendment.;negative
It's the right to have a weapon to defend ourselves from the government that will tell us we don't need them.;positive
If you gave the average person a grenade or an AK-47, what do you think they will do with it?;negative
There's a misconception that they will go mad and shoot everything in sight, when really they will probably lock it away.;negative
Now tell me, what would be more useful during a home invasion: the AK-47 or a hunting rifle?;neutral
You make a good point on the home invasion thing but how often does that actually happen?;neutral
I don't have any stats but I'm pretty sure there are a lot more accidental deaths from Timmy grabbing dad's AK and playing cowboys and indians with the neighbor kids than dad using it to stop a home invasion, and if a home invasion is reason for buying it why wouldn't a handgun do the trick?;negative
Well how often does that happen?;neutral
The death toll is below fifty a year.;negative
Not only am I talking about home invasion, but the general store robberies, madmen in public areas, etc.;negative
The death toll for them is above 300!;positive
Some people aren't comfortable enough with a gun like that.;negative
If they had something like an AK-47 what right does the government have to take his right away?;neutral
I have a strong doubt he/she is going to go on a killing spree with it.;negative
The government is there to support and protect rights, not take them away.;negative
We cannot rely on the government for all our protection, which is why the right to bear arms was put in place.;negative
I understand a natural instinct that says more gun control reduces crime, but people need to look at the actual stats!;negative
The founding fathers didn't envision phones, or television, or the internet, should our first amendment rights be limited to things they had like print, and speech?;negative
These weapons require a specific, and very expensive, permit to own.;negative
So if a man is shot with an m16 or ak47, it would be very easy for authorities to find everyone in the city who owns them and see who did it.;negative
Adding to that, People who would go on a killing rampage would not be able to obtain a license to carry these weapons.;negative
Exactly, which is why anyone with half a brain obtains these guns from shadowy sources, if they intend to commit a crime.;negative
That's exactly the point!;neutral
The fact that it is so hard to obtain a gun has created the statistic of 80 percent of all gun crimes committed with illegal firearms.;negative
Not only that, the good people who abide by the law cannot protect themselves?;negative
"“Laws that forbid the carrying of arms...disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.”";positive
(Quoting Cesare Beccaria);neutral
Wake up...no law is ever going to make the world safe and remove all accidents and crimes.;negative
The world has sharp edges and sometimes people get hurt, not to make light of this it is awful when bad things happen.;positive
However the answer isn't to have a bunch of criminals in Washington take away more of our rights, because the only people that lose are those of us that follow the law and behave responsible.;neutral
It is time for us to start remembering that liberty and freedom has a price tag...that is we may from time to time not like the actions of our neighbors.;negative
We may not like their morals, manners, or actions however if they are not harming you then its not your business.;negative
You cannot legislate human behavior or actions if I want a gun in my home it is my business, if my neighbor wants to use drugs that is his business, or marry someone of the same sex, etc..;negative
.;neutral
Stop trying to legislate a perfect world the only thing you gain is loss of liberty.;neutral
Not for nothing but the only time I was forced to use a gun for violence was when the same gang of criminals in Washington, that are often lobby to remove gun rights, sent me to some lousy desert to do there bidding.;negative
I don't support violence in any way shape or form.;negative
.;neutral
but if someone wants a gun its there business and it doesn't mean there violent people.;negative
Stop allowing these bums in D.C. to remove our rights, that is both parties, government has the monopoly on force and violence don't trust it.;negative
Make no mistake I am not an anarchist...I believe in liberty!;negative
Yes some government is needed but to enforce natural law that is it!!;negative
And not to pick on democrats but if you think your party is any better when it comes to peace then the lousy republicans...What parties held the white house during Vietnam and the Korean War.;negative
Wars of nation building that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands.;neutral
Wake up and embrace liberty it works when its real!!!;positive
I do not fully understand the purpose of such legislation.;negative
Are they trying to cut down on illegal firearms, accidental deaths, or both?;negative
I presume this pertains to the U.S.A.;negative
Illegal Firearms;neutral
Obviously, legislation cannot reduce the number of these.;negative
Accidental deaths;neutral
I believe that Liberty or Death was one of the founding principles of the U.S.A.;negative
It seems stupid to replace one tyranny with another.;negative
Governments are addicted to removing people's rights, and every effort should be made to prevent them from doing so.;negative
Both;neutral
An attempt to remove both will be covered by the above two arguments.;negative
Yes, and they are trying to do so in quite an absurd manner.;negative
Usually it does.;neutral
That's the problem with not being an American.;negative
That was the old way!;neutral
Modern Americans hardly even know about the Revolutionary War.;negative
It does, doesn't it?;negative
You'd think that people would realize this.;neutral
Mainly progressives.;neutral
They're the exact opposite of libertarians.;neutral
"Which is the reason that the ""right to bear arms"" was included in the first point.";positive
"*However, you didn't really cover accidental deaths in your ""accidental deaths"" section.";negative
Wouldn't more lives be saved by taking away all of America's legally owned guns?;negative
See liberty or death.;negative
The liberty of all overshadows the deaths of few.;negative
Actually it applies worldwide, but most western countries have populations that are fearful and spineless (I'm looking at you Britain, Australia and Canada), so America is one of the few modern nations where owning and operating guns isn't so heavily regulated, and the population has strong, vocal support for it.;negative
Guns that kill people on the street are most likely obtained illegally.;negative
Tightening gun control for legal firearms that are bought and sold legally would do nothing to stop the crime.;negative
This would only take guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.;neutral
I support this point.;neutral
Criminals could really give a fuck less what the laws are.;negative
They'll get laundered guns anyways.;negative
But if we have gun control then how are we suppose to overthrow our government when they fuck up?;neutral
"Unfortunately our government has set it up so that we cannot overthrow them, even though it is well within our rights (if not our requirement) as described in the Declaration of Independence. """;negative
"...Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness"".";negative
Our forefathers were truly amazing men.;positive
It seems most people have this fantasy about shooting somebody breaking into their house in the middle of the night.;negative
Statistically, it's far more likely that they or a member of their family, especially their own children will die as a result of there being a gun in the home, not some street hood intruding on their castle.;negative
"The classic argument is that ""Criminals don't care about gun bans, so a gun ban only takes guns out of the hands of law abiding citizens"".";negative

As can those types of weapons.;neutral
A flamethrower - however powerful it was - if used in the right location, could cause anything from mild damage to a forest fire.;neutral
No.;neutral
It is still extremely rare.;positive
It has always been rare.;positive
You have no idea.;negative
I wanted to make a plasma cannon but no one would help me with the necessary components.;negative
Plus I kept designing bombs.;negative
I was a troubled child, obviously.;negative
Oh, I read too, entirely non-fiction.;negative
It took a lot of persuasion for me to finally start reading fiction.;neutral
Most technologies we take for granted are as destructive, but we allow them.;neutral
We should be able to enjoy these weapons.;positive
"I was being sarcastic, like ""Drat!";negative
"Now we can't abduct children anymore to test our latest smallpox vaccine.""";neutral
I enjoyed the occasional fiction tale - modern, that is - however, I found them dreadfully difficult to complete.;positive
There is a difference, however: the only purpose for weapons is to - you're smart enough to figure this one out, aren't you - whereas, say, vehicles - whilst they can do grievous damage - also have benefits.;negative
Hey quick question for you...why were these weapons made?;negative
They were made for the government, the same government that wants to take them away.;negative
P.S. I have many guns and as I stated before the only time have pulled the trigger on any gun for violence was for the government.;negative
You folks that think your political party can be trusted are sadly mistaken.;negative
I'm pretty sure when our forefathers wrote the right to bear arms in the constitution they weren't envisioning the assualt rifle.;neutral
I don't have any stats but I'm pretty sure there are a lot more accidental deaths from Timmy grabbing dad's AK and playing cowboys and indians with the neighbor kids than dad using it to stop a home invasion;negative
and if a home invasion is reason for buying it why wouldn't a handgun do the trick?;neutral
M-16 or an AK-47;neutral
These weapons require a specific, and very expensive, permit to own.;negative
So if a man is shot with an m16 or ak47, it would be very easy for authorities to find everyone in the city who owns them and see who did it.;negative
Adding to that, People who would go on a killing rampage would not be able to obtain a license to carry these weapons.;negative
Are they trying to cut down on illegal firearms, accidental deaths, or both?;negative
I presume this pertains to the U.S.A.;negative
I believe that Liberty or Death was one of the founding principles of the U.S.A.;neutral
It seems stupid to replace one tyranny with another.;negative
Governments are addicted to removing people's rights,;neutral
and every effort should be made to prevent them from doing so.;neutral
"However, you didn't really cover accidental deaths in your ""accidental deaths"" section.";neutral
Wouldn't more lives be saved by taking away all of America's legally owned guns?;negative
Usually it does.;neutral
That's the problem with not being an American.;negative
Gun ownership is currently legal.;neutral
Numerous forces on the left seek to make gun ownership illegal.;negative
Most on the right seek to keep it legal.;neutral
Which position is supported by the soundest arguments?;negative
I hate guns.;negative
They kill people, guilty people, innocent people, doesn't matter... they end lives.;negative
Plain and simple.;positive
I think they should be banned, because owning a gun is like promoting violence.;negative
Even if it's for self-defense.;neutral
The world would be a much safer place without all these fire-arms.;negative
Ha.;neutral
Obviously someone who lives in Neverland.;neutral
Man was killing man long before firearms crazy.;negative
To be honest, in a whole lot more brutal fashion.;negative
All we'd have then is the same amount of violence except with blades.;negative
Wake up and look at the WORLD you are in not the fairy tale world you think your in.;negative
People like you are the people who get people killed.;neutral
Yes, I know that.;positive
I don't see that as any reason to add firearms to that increasing list of 'Methods of Killing People'.;negative
Dude.;neutral
I know the world I am in.;neutral
I was just stating that things would be better if the number of people who owned firearms would decrease significantly.;negative
Will this happen?;neutral
Probably not, but it would be better for society.;negative
How?;neutral
How can me wishing we lived in a more peaceful world cause people to be killed?;negative
I would love to know, so do explain.;positive
Wishing is doing nothing for the issue being discussed.;negative
Sure firearms kill but as I stated before people are the problem not the method in which things are killed.;negative
Yeah in.;neutral
Perfect world we would all like one another, respect one another, and the need to kill would be non existent.;negative
However, we do not live in a perfect world.;neutral
People are born everyday with weirdly wired portions of the brain that help develop them into an everyday, law abiding citizen or a rampaging lunatic that gets his jollys off by killing people.;negative
Again I see what your saying, that in the perfect world guns would not be needed and I agree.;positive
"I mean no personal offense to you in particular but when I say it's ""People like you are the people who get people killed"", I mean that mindset.";negative
Some people have a tendency to believe in world peace and its a great notion but something that will never ever be attainable, period.;positive
Why?;negative
People.;neutral
We all have our own ideas as individuals and our nations all have their own beliefs and ideas.;positive
Anytime we have a difference in opinion we all handle it differently.;neutral
My point was simply that although you have a point, in a perfect world, that fighting ownership is ridiculous.;negative
Criminals will always have guns no matter what is passed, so why would it be a good thing that they take guns away from citizens.;negative
This makes me want to pull my hair out because you think I'm that kind of person, when I actually do believe that world peace will never happen.;negative
I wish it would, but I know that we are so far gone from that path that we can never achieve that.;negative
Well the question is why do criminals have guns?;neutral
No one should have guns in the first place, but we do because violence is inevitable and that's our society for you.;negative
hands kill people too should we take those away?;neutral
like the next guy down was right there was violence long before guns.;negative
now i don't own a gun nor does any of my family but i still believe that guns don't lead to violence its just the unstable people who own them that create violence;neutral
Well, if people are unstable then why provide them with more ways to kill someone?;negative
I understand that banning guns won't stop people from killing anyone, but it will help with the situation.;neutral
Especially when you consider school shootings, or any type of shootings (like the one done at the cinemas somewhere).....;neutral
those events would not have happened if it were not for the fact that those people had access to firearms.;negative
legal or not people will have the ability to obtain guns hell i know people who would make them if they had to.;negative
and like that guys comment, he said something along the lines of he doesn't want to be defenseless if the gov fails or needs fixing look at Libya.;negative
do you think their revolution would've succeeded if under your law?;negative
no.;neutral
and there government would still be oppressive and restrict freedoms we take for granted... in summation, maybe one day we will live in a world where there is no need for guns but lets not declaw the american people just yet.;negative
guns should be banned because there are to many people being killed and pro like former military people should not be allowed to have guns because they are pros at that so basically they are trained killers and trained killers should not have guns;neutral
Guns are dangerous and I think they should be banned.;negative
There is way too much gun violence in America.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
Guns aren't there just to protect yourself - guns are also there to protect you from tyranny.;neutral
Disarming the people makes them defenseless against an opressive government.;negative
Guns don't kill people, people kill people plain and simple.;negative
That's like blaming your pencil for misspelled words.;negative
It's ridiculous.;negative
I've been to several countries and have seen first hand what disarming the public can do.;neutral
It leads to an uncontrolled government who takes your liberties away little by little.;neutral
The world does not exist in your perfect hippie plain of rainbows and butterflies.;negative
It's filled with horrible people who do not care about human existence.;negative
I will never relinquish my firearms to anyone or anybody.;negative
It's my constitutional right and keeps me safe from evil men.;positive
Yes the world would be better without them completely but that's fantasy and will never happen.;neutral
If you disarm citizens guess who will still have them?;neutral
Oh yeah, criminals cause ya know its kinda their thing to break laws.;negative
They will never ban guns in the United States of America because we, the people, will not allow our rights to be violated and raped by ridiculous individuals who believe we all hold hands.;negative
Wake up and smell the roses people the world is ugly and is not this Mecca you believe it to be.;negative
I believe in freedom.;positive
gun owners dont try to force us to own guns why should we take them away?;negative
... usually my responses are longer and have larger words but like guns probably this comment will be short lived.;negative
In light of the recent Conn. shooting.;neutral
I think the problem of nut cases going on shooting rampages can best be solved by 1) If a person has been seeing a psychiatrist & taking prescription meds for say 1 or 2 yrs+ and the Pysch has any concerns about the mental stability of the patient, then they need to be put on a Gun Ban list.;negative
Can't by ANY guns.;neutral
2) Cut out most of the violence in Video Games & movies.;neutral
Especially some of the hard core video games.;negative
Younger people see so much violence.;negative
3) Better security at schools, Malls, & other places of large gatherings.;positive
Parents could have IDs w/ their picture & the picture of their kids on the same ID.;negative
If they have a lot of kids @ 1 school, they could have 2 ids.;negative
When they pick up their kid, they show their ID at a entry point.;neutral
Who ever picks up the kids could have an id & if Grandma or Aunt Sue is picking up on occasion, Parent + designated person could notify the school ahead of time.;negative
Anyone w/out ID is stopped, questioned & sent to the main office for any further needed questioning.;negative
Malls & the like could have metal detectors at the entrance.;negative
If you set it off, you get searched (respectfully).;negative
Maybe it was just a big metal belt buckle, but checkout just to be safe.;neutral
Why I don't think banning guns or even assault rifles will help: 1) People who really want 'em will find a way to get them.;negative
2) Bans only really affect law abiding citizens.;negative
Most of them aren't going to abuse it (assuming their sane - see above).;negative
Drugs are illegal...how many drug problems do we have in the US?;negative
People who really want them will get them anyway.;neutral
Europe has gun bans and they still have problems.;negative
3) Banning guns, even assault rifles keeps arms out of the hands of responsible citizens.;negative
Criminals will be embolden knowing Joe Q Public can't buy a gun.;neutral
4) Governments through out history have often abused their power & oppressed people when they think they can.;negative
A large populous with guns keeps Gov. a little on the cautious side.;negative
Just before Hitler took over he removed the guns from the citizens.;negative
He stated it was for everyone's safety and well being.;positive
Soon after he rounded up and exterminated people.;positive
Had the Jews and Polish had guns, the tragedy may not have happened.;negative
Or at least not to the extent that it did.;neutral
Disarmed People = Are Dominated People;neutral
Simple as that so do we really want to ban guns?;negative
Man was killing man long before firearms crazy.;negative
Wake up and look at the WORLD you are in not the fairy tale world you think your in.;negative
People like you are the people who get people killed.;neutral
Some people have a tendency to believe in world peace and its a great notion but something that will never ever be attainable, period.;positive
Criminals will always have guns no matter what is passed, so why would it be a good thing that they take guns away from citizens.;negative
http://ivoter.com/the-dick-act-of-1902-also-known-as-the-efficiency-of-militia-bill/;neutral
http://ivoter.com/the-dick-act-of-1902-also-known-as-the-efficiency-of-militia-bill/;neutral
Actually gun control isn't illegal if the laws exist.;negative
You're confusing illegal with unconstitutional.;negative
No according the the Dick act of 1902 also called the efficiency of the militia act any law effecting the efficiancy of the citizens militia is invalade.;neutral
Here's a link http://ivoter.com/the-dick-act-of-1902-also-known-as-the-efficiency-of-militia-bill/;neutral
Which is why I used the word 'if' .;negative
Yes but what I'm saying is that law can't exist in this country be oust would be in violation of both the constitution and the Dick act of 1902.;negative
If the law is not constitutional the law itself is illegal.;negative
This is the very point that was made about the laws which once upheld slavery.;negative
Wasn't it?;negative
That's correct in theory, but I don't see it being practiced in today's world.;negative
Let's face it, the country is becoming authoritarian.;positive
Too much power being grabbed by the government...;negative
That's what the 2nd Amendment was written in anticipation of.;negative
Why do you think they're limiting magazine sizes and such?;negative
They're working towards a ban.;neutral
And if you think the people will just rise up as one, forget it.;negative
Most people are sheep and will act counter to what is best for the survival of the country.;positive
Since in life, sheep are very, very stupid creatures.;negative
They will follow a lead sheep to their death, even off a cliff.;negative
When guns are totally banned, only criminals will have them... and I will be one of em.;negative
So, all I can say is... I'll deal with that day when it comes.;positive
Not that I believe it ever will.;neutral
You're far more optimistic than I am, then .;negative
I'm more prepared and confident than I am optimistic.;positive
But yeah, I can see how that is about the same.;positive
Duplicate posts.......;neutral
argh!!;neutral
!;neutral
Dupe removed..... 50 characters blah blah;negative
blah;negative
Thank you, I think that was the term I was looking for.;negative
TO who ever downvoted me, it'd be more efficient in proving your point by leaving a reason, in either the form of a dispute or a clarification for why I was downvoted.;negative
Simply downvoting does not let me know my error.;negative
What's legal is what the government says is legal.;neutral
If the government wants to arrest you without due process, without giving a reason, they very well can and it won't be labeled illegal because they make, and they enforce the laws.;positive
No not in this country.;neutral
Here the government is limited in what it can and cannot do by a system of checks and balances as well as the bill of rights.;negative
Those are all the government, if it has gotten as far as the people, and the government (the president, the congress, the supreme court) has decided on gun control, who's going to arrest them for it?;neutral
The militias.;neutral
That's the whole reason for the second amendment after all.;neutral
Think of it as the ultimate check against tyranny.;negative
Okay.;neutral
The militia is not the government.;negative
It's your right to rise up against that law, if the population didn't vote on it.;neutral
That does not mean you are legally allowed to.;negative
You would still be arrested.;neutral
Tyranny is of a tyrant's, rule.;neutral
As in a tyrant's law.;neutral
If you are acting outside of the law, you are doing something illegal.;negative
The militia is the people and in this country the people ARE the government.;neutral
The laws are not enforced by the people.;negative
They are not made by the people.;negative
The people are supposed to have power in government, in a democracy, but if the acting ruler says screw democracy, the people are no longer the government, they are just civilians to be ruled.;negative
And that's not how our country was meant to be.;negative
We chose our rulers they work for us when they don't do the move we hired them to we fire them and when they turn on us we punish them hence the reason we have the second amendment.;negative
Yes, all of this is true.;positive
Yet what is legal, is what the government, as in the officials in charge, say.;negative
If they say it's legal to revoke your rights, it's legal.;negative
You obviously can still fight for them, but you will be acting outside of the law.;neutral
We will be out side the laws of an unlawful government.;negative
And within the law of the constitution.;neutral
The government wrote the constitution.;neutral
This whole debate is like saying would killing someone be illegal in anarchy.;negative
If there is no government there are no official laws.;negative
You are pressing a point that is literally not worth pressing.;negative
What difference does it make if we say that gun control is illegal?;neutral
Who's going to arrest them?;neutral
Who would arrest them?;neutral
Law enforcement politicians aren't above the law.;negative
The fact it in this country there are some things the government is simply not allowed to do.;negative
Law enforcement, and politicians don't have to be above the law they make it.;negative
If it's made into a law that people are no longer allowed to have guns.;negative
Cops won't start arresting the government for that.;negative
If anything, cops will come to where you live to take your guns, seeing as they work for the government.;negative
"Yet as it's been brought to my attention, the word I've been neglecting this whole time is ""right"".";negative
"It is legal, but it's not ""right"".";negative
In some places that might happen but I happen to know police officers both in real life and on the Internet who have told me that if such a thing were to happen they would be more likely to quit the force and join the rebellion that such an event would be shure to incite then disarm law abiding citizens.;negative
Exactly!;neutral
They'd quit the force.;negative
Then they would join the group of people acting outside of the law.;neutral
You don't get it, you're even saying it.;negative
It would under no circumstances be right to force law abiding citizens give up their guns, but the government does not have to uphold your rights, that's a courtesy you happen to have because you live in a democracy.;negative
They make the laws, what they say is legal, is.;neutral
What they say is illegal isn't.;negative
Is it illegal to ban marijuana?;neutral
Right ≠ Legal.;negative
The constitution limits the power of the government they can't just do whatever they want.;neutral
If they make a law that violates the constitution it becomes invalade.;negative
The constitution is made by the government.;neutral
Let me ask you something:;neutral
Was what Hitler did illegal?;negative
Why is it legal to ban marijuana but not to ban guns or cigarettes?;negative
What hitler did was legal because the German constitution didn't forbid it.;negative
And it is legal to ban marijuana and cigarets but guns are protected by the constitution.;neutral
So you're saying the German constitution didn't have any rules about genocide, or shutting down people's rights?;neutral
Well being that I've never read the document I wouldn't know.i'm just guessing.;negative
You don't think that guess was a little unfounded?;neutral
What government would set up it's principles with mass genocide being legal?;negative
The reason he wasn't illegal, is because he had all the power, and declared it more or less legal.;negative
Here's another example, during world war two, in America their were Japanese Internment.;neutral
Why was that not illegal or if it was why didn't the government get arrested?;negative
Before you call red herring, I thought about that, and it's not to distract from the point, it's to address the similarities to the government doing something unconstitutional, but it still not being called illegal because they are the government.;negative
Just because the government got away with it doesn't mean they didn't commit a crime.;negative
What I see happening now is a growing number of people standing up and saying next time will be different next time they won't get away with it next time we will act.;positive
Then what makes it a crime officially?;neutral
I feel like that's where our true argument lies.;negative
Duplicate;neutral
Not ALL governments my friend.;negative
What does this mean as a dispute to my former statement?;neutral
As stated many times you mean unconstitutional.;neutral
It's essentially the same thing.;neutral
Because its illegal for the government to violate the constitution.;neutral
legal = / =right;neutral
I'm well aware of that.;positive
A dictator does, in his country, legal things that exploit the rights of his citizens often.;negative
I never said legal was right, I only stated the government is not doing anything illegal by making unjust laws.;negative
It's not illegal but unconstitutional... rednecks :D;negative
That's the same thing.;neutral
It is illegal for the government to do anything that is unconstitutional.;negative
So illegal and unconstitutional mean essentially the same thing.;negative
In your country... not mine.;neutral
That is why it is unconstitutional, but not illegal.;negative
It's illegal in my country.;neutral
Laws very form country to country you know.;negative
Exactly- so it's not really illegal- only illegal in the US.;negative
That's the point I'm trying to get across.;negative
Sorry I sometimes forget that not everyone on this site is an American.;negative
My god you love your guns.;positive
I wonder if its a psychosexual thing.;neutral
No it's a rights sort of thing.;negative
The fact of the matter is when a government distrusts its citizens with guns its probably because its up to something the citizens won't like.;negative
I see.;positive
.;neutral
and this thing that the citizens don't like (lets call it 'top secret plan X' from now on) won't be successful if citizens have guns?;negative
Because they'll shoot the government?;negative
It's easier to oppress people who aren't armed.;neutral
Remember we beat the professional well trained well equipped British army when we were nothing more than a barely organized band of farmers and shop keepers.;positive
Okay.;neutral
Well, I don't think there's any evidence for this top secret plan X and I don't think many people actually believe that...;negative
"I'm going with the psychosexual thing ;)";neutral
Was there any evidence of the holocaust that was available to the German people during or prior to the time period in wich the genocide occurred?;negative
No.;neutral
Was there any evidence that Stalin purposefully starved thousands of Ukrainian farmers to death that was available to the rest of the world during of prior to the time period in which the genocide occurred?;negative
No.;neutral
Was there any evidence of the Armenian genocide that was available to the rest of the world during or prior to the time period in which the genocide occurred?;negative
No.;neutral
Did the Jewish people have any way of knowing about the concentration amps and death camps prior to their arrival to such facility's?;neutral
No.;neutral
Did the lack of evidence for any of the afore mentioned occurrences/ facility's mean that they did not happen/ exist?;negative
No.;neutral
Just because you are not aware of something doesn't mean it isn't real.;negative
Well yes there was evidence of the holocault.;neutral
But anyway that's not the point.;negative
The point is why do you believe in top secret plan X?;negative
Just because they're trying to take your guns away?;neutral
So therefore they must be trying to exterminate you?;neutral
Is that really how your logic works?;negative
My point was that even though evidence for those genocides existed the people not directly involved where unaware of it so as far as they were concerned there was no evidence.;negative
And if you went back in time and tried to tell them about what was going on they would probably call you a conspiracy theorist.;negative
But any way to answer your question its not that I think the government is going to commit a genocide but I do see that my government is and has for some time been becoming more and more powerful and controlling.;negative
I don't think it is, and I have even read where Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, stated that the Second Amendment can be modified.;negative
Well, that machine gun shit can go.;negative
No ordinary citizen needs one.;negative
Ordinary citizens do not carry machine guns.;negative
You need a special license in order to own one.;neutral
You need a license to own any gun, don't you?;negative
When I say ordinary, I mean non-police and military.;negative
Not in my state.;neutral
Yea, that's what I'm saying.;neutral
You need a special certification to own a machine gun.;neutral
Basically what I'm saying is a ban on assault rifles seems necessary.;neutral
Anyone can get this special certification, right?;positive
Technically no citizen owns assault rifles unless you got the certain certification.;negative
AR 15s are actually sporting rifles.;negative
"And by the way, ""assault rifles"" are not machine guns.";negative
It depends what state you live in.;neutral
In some states they are illegal even for government employees.;negative
However in others they are legal under certain circumstances.;neutral
Yeah... so people DO own assault rifles.;negative
Can you explain what this certification is?;neutral
I'm guessing anyone can get it if they pass a class of some sort.;positive
Sorry, I'm not a gun guy.;negative
I know there are little machine guns and big machine guns.;negative
Obviously the little ones aren't rifles... but should still be banned in my opinion, as well as assault rifles.;negative
Could you just sum up what the majority of states allow?;negative
Yea but those guys are mostly once government employees before.;neutral
"I'm just saying AR15s and other ""assault rifles"" are not assault rifles.";negative
EDIT: Remember that fully automatic rifles cost A LOT of money.;negative
No one is going to buy a fully automatic rifle for thousands of dollars unless they do business with them.;negative
From MY knowledge it is called a Fully Automatic Gun License (I think it is a certain class of license and such).;negative
Again it depends what state you are in.;neutral
Some states may require a class some may not.;negative
For instance, in Tennessee you need a special license to carry a concealed handgun, but in Georgia you don't need a license.;negative
Well, I've been shooting guns all my life.;negative
My family showed me how to fire a weapon, load a weapon, and strip down and clean a weapon.;negative
They taught me gun safety and made me take a hunter safety class before I ever went on a hunt.;negative
I'm not a machine gun guy so I really don't know much about them either.;negative
AL, AK, AZ, AR, CO, CT, FL, GA, ID, IN, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MN, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, WV, WI, WY.;negative
You must be 21 and have registered with the ATF before ever getting the permit.;negative
Again this is MY knowledge.;neutral
If you have the time and want to research it you may find more information.;neutral
But the fact of the matter is that it isn't only ex-government employees who have machine guns (or assault rifles).;negative
The Sandy Hook, Columbine, and Aurora shootings were all examples of this.;negative
Nobody is hunting with a machine gun... however, I don't see any reason to take away any other type of gun.;negative
There was no assault rifle used in any of the mass shootings.;negative
Not only is it illegal to hunt with a machine gun, again, a machine gun is not a sports rifle.;negative
A gun is a gun.;neutral
All guns can kill just like anyone can use an axe or hammer to kill.;negative
I'm going to be frank;neutral
The only reason why the government targets sports rifles is because it scares them.;negative
Its just a baby step to get rid of American citizens rights.;negative
The President himself said the Constitution just limits us (as in them, the politicians).;negative
Don't look at it from an American media's eyes.;negative
Look at it from all angles.;neutral
"That's why I said ""machine guns (or assault rifles)"".";negative
I wasn't sure which.;negative
You don't need to clarify my own argument for me.;negative
I understood what I said.;neutral
Which type of gun can kill more people in the masses in a matter of seconds?;negative
Let's ban that kind.;neutral
Okay, I'll be Ted.;negative
Well, they are guns.;neutral
Yeah, I've heard that argument before.;negative
That's just an opinion... or a conspiracy theory.;neutral
Yeah, well... the President kind of sucks.;negative
What can I say?;neutral
Lol;neutral
Which I do... and I can see it from your angle... but I feel like the pros from my angle outweigh the pros from your's.;negative
You know I am pretty sure his point is that ordinary citizens can own machine guns if they get the permits.;negative
Having special permits doesn't exactly make a citizen more than ordinary.;negative
Why not?;negative
Citizens should be allowed to own something more than a little pistol.;negative
They can still own something more... just a machine gun or an assault rifle seems unnecessary.;negative
Assault rifle isn't even a gun term, its just a name that people use to describe any gun that looks scary, and it appears that people find guns with handles and stocks to be scary.;negative
Whats wrong with owning a gun that is fully-automatic?;negative
Why should we allow a person to have a black rifle?;negative
Or a automatic weapon?;neutral
If a kid gets their hands on that and just so happens to play Call of Duty some problems will occur.;neutral
Why should we allow them to have it is what my question is.;neutral
Oh yeah, because kids can't tell the difference between a video game and real life, they'll pick it up, shoot their family and things its a game, right?;negative
No.;neutral
Kids just want to copy what they see.;neutral
Now what is your reason for wanting people to own such deadly weapons?;neutral
Not all kids want to copy what they see, and when they do, they don't want to copy everything.;negative
I'm pretty sure that 99.99% of the population understands that killing your parents in real life is different then killing a made up villain in a video game.;negative
These weapons are for self defense, I want people to have the ability to defend themselves with these weapons.;negative
Assault Rifle- A rapid fire, magazine fed automatic rifle designed for infantry use.;negative
It is a gun term.;neutral
Why does anyone need it?;negative
Shooting targets is about all they can do with it.;negative
Nobody is going hunting with a machine gun.;positive
It is a military weapon.;neutral
First off all, military rifles that are given to infantry are not rapid fire, they are selective fire.;negative
Most people don't buy guns for hunting, they buy them for protection.;negative
Gangs, swat, police and military all have selective fire rifles, why can't a citizen have one?;negative
That is not the definition that congress and the media are using when they say assault rifle, though.;negative
You know why the second amendment was written, right?;negative
"You're going to say ""so that American citizens can protect themselves from tyranny"" or something along those lines, right?";neutral
Yep.;neutral
I guess you disagree with that?;negative
I feel like that is a little far-fetched as of now.;negative
American's can still have their guns, but I don't agree with them having military-grade weapons.;negative
I guess you believe the government is heading towards a tyranny, right?;neutral
All governments do at sometime.;neutral
Especially when you have two parties that are running the system.;neutral
Yes, it is obvious that the US Government has defied the Constitution.;negative
Gun control must be implemented to curtail this shameful gun violence in our country.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral

For fuck sack America,it's time to swap for a knife,crocodile Dundee,that is not a knife,this is a knife.;negative
Good movie.;positive
None of the US shootings were with machine guns, guys.;negative
They were with semi automatic weapons.;neutral
We don't need another gun law.;negative
Are you fucking crazy?;neutral
, semi auto, machines whats the fucking difference, 1 bullet a second is more then enough do mass killings, hell I can kill 6 people in 6 seconds with a 6 shooter.;negative
Bottom line it does not matter if the killings where from a machine gun or a musket the bottom line is people are dieing from guns, and I'm going to tell you what, I am willing to bet you do not what to live in a world where guns are law, it might sound good to you republicans but you motherfuckers are the first one to run with you tails between your legs when bullets start flying, I know first hand bro, I live in the inner city with gang bangers and ever day many people die from a guns, you might think its cool to watch TV or some John Wayne film but let me tell you it's no fun.;negative
"My views: Yes we should protect the second amendment, but, ""NO"" should we allow everyone to get there hands on guns.";negative
"we need to close the loop holes so the ghetto fucks around my area can't get there hands on guns and the sick ""Adam Lanzers"" in the suburbs cant murder children.";negative
Woah, calm down.;neutral
It may surprise you to know that I'm a centrist, and an independent.;positive
If you don't believe me, I already posted my full views for review.;negative
Guns that can fire an excess of 1000 bullets per minute are just so much more dangerous than 1 per second (which is a small fraction of that amount).;negative
I don't watch television, and I hardly ever watch movies (I hate action movies anyways), I don't even know who John Wayne is, and quite frankly I don't care.;negative
Also, I doubt that you could actually kill 6 people in six seconds with a six shooter.;negative
Depending on your aim, you'd be lucky to get 4 even if they were lined up.;neutral
In a crowd, 2ish.;positive
I'd like to see where exactly you found out that GOPer's are the first to run.;negative
I am not one, but statistically I would guess the opposite.;negative
Anyone with a lick of an aim can shoot 6 in 6 seconds with a 6 shooter, as for the GOP running from gun fire it's almost fact that most chicken hawks are republicans, they love war so long as they are not the ones fighting, every war for the most part has been fought by non republican because most military soldiers are minorities or the poor, not rich white republicans, and is the reason they have the name chicken hawks.;negative
Proof is look at the American military, it's like 80% minorities, facts or facts.;negative
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that minorities are not that high, where are you getting that figure?;negative
Anyone with a lick of aim can shoot 6 with 6 shooter in six seconds?;negative
That reaaaaally depends on where the shooting takes place.;neutral
How many democrats do you see in the military?;neutral
Again, I'm referring to their tendency to enlist, regardless of their beliefs.;negative
Check the facts ..........................................................;neutral
I just did.;neutral
For the military, the majority are still whites, and they are still more likely than any other group to enlist.;negative
And military people tend to lean right on the whole.;neutral
So, about stepping up, conservatives are just much much more likely to enlist.;negative
Seriously, I'm going to need you to cite the 80 percent thing b/c I haven't found anything remotely close to that.;negative
You need a license to own any gun, don't you?;negative
When I say ordinary, I mean non-police and military.;negative
Basically what I'm saying is a ban on assault rifles seems necessary;negative
Anyone can get this special certification, right?;positive
Technically no citizen owns assault rifles unless you got the certain certification.;negative
AR 15s are actually sporting rifles.;negative
"And by the way, ""assault rifles"" are not machine guns.";negative
Depends what state you live in.;neutral
Yeah... so people DO own assault rifles;negative
Can you explain what this certification is?;neutral
I'm guessing anyone can get it if they pass a class of some sort.;positive
Sorry, I'm not a gun guy.;negative
I know there are little machine guns and big machine guns.;negative
Obviously the little ones aren't rifles... but should still be banned in my opinion, as well as assault rifles.;negative
Could you just sum up what the majority of states allow?;negative
But the fact of the matter is that it isn't only ex-government employees who have machine guns (or assault rifles).;negative
The Sandy Hook, Columbine, and Aurora shootings were all examples of this;neutral
Nobody is hunting with a machine gun...;positive
however, I don't see any reason to take away any other type of gun.;negative
There was no assault rifle used in any of the mass shootings.;negative
Not only is it illegal to hunt with a machine gun, again, a machine gun is not a sports rifle.;negative
A gun is a gun.;neutral
All guns can kill just like anyone can use an axe or hammer to kill.;negative
I'm going to be frank;neutral
The only reason why the government targets sports rifles is because it scares them.;negative
Its just a baby step to get rid of American citizens rights.;negative
The President himself said the Constitution just limits us (as in them, the politicians).;negative
Don't look at it from an American media's eyes.;negative
Look at it from all angles.;neutral

Noone, should carry a gun.;neutral
There could be accidental crimes, like you could kill people by mistake, of sudden emotion,.;negative
If we really need to carry a gun, it should be non-life taking guns such as gas guns in case we face dangerous situations.;negative
Real guns are too bloody.;negative
You can't kill someone by mistake you have to make a decision to point the gun and pull the trigger.;negative
i would not carry a gun because they are very dangerous also i don't want to be wanted for killing people and people saying i have one or most important i don't want to load it wrong and kill my self;neutral
we should not be allowed to carry guns , because of the gangsters and others who shoot at will , the 13-15 year olds who fight with steel rods would exchange their weapons with guns, and those who are mentally ill would carry guns too.;negative
Should you carry guns?;neutral
Fuck no.;neutral
Not in USA or UK anyway - culture plays a huge part in the abuse of guns.;negative
This isn't a question about rights - it's whether it's right or not right.;negative
Guns are created for one purpose - to harm.;positive
To kill.;neutral
Whether you use it in defence or attack it serves on purpose.;neutral
There's more than one way to attack and there's more than one way to defend.;negative
Guns shouldn't be in either option.;negative
Idiots argue that if somebody invades your home with a gun then you need one.;negative
Guns would be made so difficult to acquire that guns would be used so rarely that nobody (or rarely) would bring it to rob a home.;negative
"""Not in USA or UK anyway""---ok we give india all the guns then ?";negative
yeh you would like that wouldnt you?;negative
dont worry the world is giving in to all of indias demands KINDA.;neutral
you dont need to to take our guns , just ask ,we will give you cunts them too no doubt.;negative
Well actually I was referring to Finland or Switzerland who have high numbers of gun ownership and low numbers of gun crime.;negative
You wouldn't know though.;negative
Fuckface.;neutral
If everyone carried a gun people would get mad and start shooting people and everything would be a pile of blood and guts I like guns but the world would be a big disaster if everyone carried a gun.;negative
Do you carry car keys or a cellular phone around with you?;neutral
How about a belt?;neutral
I know how to kill people very easily with all three of those items.;negative
I'm sure if someone was intent on killing a person, they could learn how to kill with those items as well.;negative
But I have never killed anyone though, and I never intend to.;negative
What it really boils down to is that a gun is only a tool.;negative
If someone is deranged enough to start killing innocent people, it won't really matter whether they can have a gun or not, they will simply use another tool.;negative
And since there aren't mass murderings on a regular basis (in civilized countries anyways) it's fairly safe to assume that there aren't very many homicidal maniacs out there.;negative
It is best not to carry a gun.;positive
It is now 2015 and there is too much gun violence in America.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral

"I don't really get how this is an answer, but yes... we should ""should you carry a gun"".";neutral
I mean, if you don't want to, go ahead, but it just makes things much easier if EVERYONE carried a gun.;negative
Humans would react to each other much differently and burglaries would most likely be less.;negative
I like guns, and I will do my part in eliminating the criminal world by enacting my Castle Doctrine rights whenever necessary.;negative
Plus, if ever necessary, we have a revolution to get ready for.;negative
Basically, we fight once they try to take away our guns.;neutral
And there's stuff like fighting invading terrorists, shit like that.;negative
The decision is up to you.;neutral
We should have the freedom to carry guns.;neutral
The government should NOT have the power to take away our guns-- If you want to carry a gun, you have the right to do so.;positive
"Remember a disarmed people is a obedient group of people ;)";neutral
Here is yet another story of a citizen stopped a crime from occurring because luckily he was armed link is in my comment bellow.;negative
Here's the link again;neutral
http://gunssavelives.net/self-defense/video/video-young-man-in-jacksonville-shoots-and-kills-2-armed-home-invaders-saves-his-roommates/;neutral
First off that is a single story, so the idea that this 'proof' is even at all significant can be rejected without further investigation.;negative
Secondly, your argument is that guns are alright because they can be used to stop crime.;negative
My argument is that risk of death attributed to guns is significantly higher in the US, because you have extraordinarily many guns, which is worse than however many lesser crimes are prevented.;negative
We don't like crime of any sorts, but arguably the worst thing that can happen is people being killed.;negative
http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/10/929.full;neutral
Actually, in a situation where a citizen stops a shooting compared to a police officer, the citizens have an average loss of life of 2.3 while police have an average of 14.3.;negative
32 people may die daily, but an average of 2,191 people save their lives daily by using a gun.;negative
Or around 2 million people yearly!;neutral
The reason guns are more dangerous to be around is because they are dangerous.;negative
Plain and simple.;positive
It's the stupid person who leaves his guns around unlocked and loaded in reach of others.;negative
It's the smart gun owner to keep it unloaded and locked up in a safe.;positive
The solution isn't banning guns, but showing people how to properly care for them.;negative
Then we can prevent negligent killings.;neutral
Okay so now we are in the business of controlling human behaviour, so why don't we just cut to the root of the problem and make people peaceful, instead of playing around with teaching people how to deal with their death-toys?;negative
Yeah let's just defend ourselves by telling murderers with guns to be peaceful.;negative
Sounds great.;positive
I was being sarcastic, you know.;negative
Did I say human behavior?;neutral
Safety is easy to show, more logical than banning guns and leaving over 2,000 people to go to their deaths everyday.;negative
What you are trying to achieve is impossible.;neutral
You can't make everyone love each other.;negative
Yes you did:;neutral
The solution isn't banning guns, but showing people how to properly care for them.;negative
I know we can't make anyone love each other, and that was my exact point.;negative
You were saying we should change how people deal with guns.;neutral
That would be an attempt to change human behavior.;negative
I said that since we are in the business of dealing with human behavior we might as well deal with the root of the problem.;neutral
You then explained that it would be absurd to make everyone love each other.;negative
I think your criticism goes right back at yourself.;neutral
You can't make stupid people not stupid.;negative
It isn't human behavior I'm wanting to fix.;negative
That would be like trying to make everyone less violent, or feel a certain way.;negative
Teaching someone to keep a firearm unloaded and help them get a safe for it isn't changing human behavior.;negative
People don't have a natural urge to leave guns around where others can grab them, or keep a firearm loaded and in reach of children.;negative
Behavior is how someone acts to someone else or how they react.;neutral
Teaching someone how to keep a firearm safely is more of a physical situation rather than a behavioral one, actually teaching them how to handle a weapon and store it safely.;negative
It would seriously be the same if I taught you how to use a blender and not get your fingers caught in it.;negative
Lazyness might perfectly well not be in the same category as compassion, but to propose it isn't a defining trait in human behavior is obviously wrong.;negative
Teaching people how to deal with weapons is one thing.;negative
Making people actually follow rules is quite another.;neutral
"You are hoping people won't be lazy, etc, but that's just that; you are hoping people will act accordingly when you tell them what to do.";negative
If that were the case we wouldn't need guns in the first place, because then people wouldn't commit crimes.;negative
Which would be nice, but it is never going to happen in humanities history, so why do you want to try it?;negative
It is not going to work.;negative
Teaching them the safety is important, but whether they follow it is up to them, it's free choice.;negative
Making people actually follow the rules is impossible, I know that.;negative
So what makes you think Americans will follow gun-control laws when the government tells us what to do?;neutral
According to human behavior, they won't.;neutral
So why make it hard on everybody and ban them?;negative
I am not so cocksure.;negative
I am just trying to convey the idea that it might not be the best idea to have literally tons of weapons in a community.;negative
When and how the amount of guns should be reduced I have no idea of.;negative
"However, what I am sure of is that if you want to maintain that ""making people actually follow the rules is impossible"", you will have to agree that we have to physically restrict people if we want to change things.";neutral
If we want to change things we can't depend on an assumption that people 'will do the right thing'.;neutral
"Now if we agree that it's a problem that people have effective means of killing each other (and I am aware that's one very big if), you will have to agree that we need to ""make it hard on everybody and ban them"", because ""according to human behavior, they won't"" follow rules.";neutral
Whether it's a problem that people can kill each other in the blink of an eye is another debate entirely of course.;negative
But the thing is, there is no good reason to ban them.;negative
I have shown you that more people would be victimized and killed if guns are banned and instead of 32 deaths daily, it would be around 2,000.;negative
Guns are the first line of defense of your home, your person, and your country.;neutral
If you are enough of a scholar, you should know that histories greatest atrocities and genocides were not caused by citizens, but by governments.;negative
All of whom disarmed their populace.;neutral
I'm sorry to say, but I don't think you have much faith in people.;negative
Some people will not do the right thing, true.;negative
But the vast majority of people are smart, informed people that can make logical decisions.;positive
If they are smart enough to handle your stocks, teach your children at school, advise you on your health, advise you on your financial future, you vote for them to represent you, and care enough to be your friend, then they are probably smart enough to safely handle a firearm and have the right to defend themselves and their families.;negative
They just need to have the opportunity to be shown how if they choose to own a firearm.;negative
If you seriously want to forcefully disarm people, you are going to have to put a gun to their heads, or a gun to the heads of their wife, or daughter, or son, or husband, because they would probably rather die than give up their right.;negative
That would make you a person equal to Hitler if you decided to do something like that.;neutral
And seriously, you just defeated yourself.;negative
If you ban them, people will not follow that rule.;negative
It isn't because they won't follow the rules, it's because it gives power to the government under the cover of protecting you.;positive
Why make 150 million Americans criminals and have them not follow the rules?;negative
They are not doing anything wrong.;negative
Banning them will not make them just give up and follow the rules, but the complete opposite, making it way worse than before.;negative
Well of course we wouldn't want to ban them just like that, I agree with you entirely.;neutral

I don't at all sympathize with Obama's plans to take away your guns, but I if the status quo can be changed in a democratic, reasonable manner I think you ought to follow through.;negative
You don't seem to care or even to be aware of the fact that the primary reason for the right to keep and bear arms is for the people to have the means to defend themselves... even against the tyranny of their own government (should it ever to become necessary for them to do so - again).;negative
I am aware of that fact yes.;neutral
I am sorry for reiterating but I think doing so is kind of appropriate:;neutral

We have a government in Denmark.;neutral
We don't have guns.;negative
We don't think we need guns to protect ourselves from each other.;negative
I am not saying that you should take away your right to keep and bear arms right now.;negative
I am only proposing that it's an ideal that might become realistic sometime in the future.;positive
I think that you might have a different point of view if you actually had the same history in your country that we do ours.;neutral
In other words, our demand for guns (to defend ourselves and our liberties) is a direct result of having to use guns to secure those rights and freedoms in the first place.;negative
We don't trust our government and we (many of us) don't believe we ever should trust that much power to a government again.;negative
It's just not going to happen because that mindset is passed from generation to generation from one gun owning person to another.;negative
That is why I pointed out that it must be a democratic decision to implement such restrictions.;negative
Those who ignore or dismiss history are doomed (destined) to repeat it.;positive
Don't you agree?;negative
Why would the people give their ultimate power back to a government that we can't even trust to be responsible with our money?;negative
I agree, but that doesn't change that having zero weapons is ideal, if the societal circumstances allow for such a restriction.;negative
You would have to convince me (an a lot of others) about how having zero weapons would be ideal.;negative
Especially, when it is a given that legal or not... Criminals are going to have them.;neutral
Well I don't think it is going to be very hard to convince people, if only I could express myself clearly...;negative
When I say that it would be ideal to have no weapons I am intending to express what I am litterally saying.;neutral
It would be ideal if no one had weapons, not criminals, not police (although they should obviously have some kind of non-lethal way of controlling people).;negative
I disagree if criminals get killed I consider that a great thing.;negative
It's a simple fact that banning guns dose not stop crime it simply makes it Easier for the criminals to intimidate the citizens.;negative
The worst thing is leavening innocents at the mercy of criminal gangs with no means of defense.;negative
Okay.;neutral
Of course the use of guns can stop crime.;neutral
It's just that the media only reports stories of the rare mass shootings by two clearly insane sisters.;negative
Dude, we don't have to justify our Constitutional right to keep and bear arms to them.;negative

Is there any other way to protect myself?;neutral
If guns don't shoot people, people shoot people.;negative
Guns don't stop crimes, people stop crimes.;negative
That's true, but they won't be able to without the guns.;neutral
Unless you are just that brave and are willing to risk you life for someone.;positive
No one wants to really risk their life, having a gun reduces the risk in those situations.;negative
Lol I know.;neutral
Or you could use the death stare like chuck norris can do.;neutral
Just take them out by starring at them.;neutral

Yes that's true people stop crimes but it helps to be armed because often times the criminals are armed.;positive

I don't exactly understand what the point of disputing or even responding is.;negative
It's very obvious that a gun won't just fire, the whole point of my comment was sarcasm.;negative

And you'll risk getting killed in the process?;neutral
Thats a really stupid selfish decisión.;negative
You had to get yourself killed and leave your family alone just for the sake of money?;negative
The Smart thing to do in such a situation is not to return fire.;negative
Just give them the money - it is only money.;negative
Despite being a capitalist nation I guess you can see that your life is more valuable than that.;neutral
This is ignoring the fact that some of us believe that killing is wrong.;negative
If you practice your aim and quick draw you want have to worry about death they will hit the ground before they know what's going on.;negative
My home is my castle my loved ones and property are my treasure and any one who wants to try to harm or steal what's mine is going to hell end of story.;positive
And it's not that I don't think killing is wrong but killing in self defense is at least justified.;negative
the smart thing to do is give them the money you mean give in to intimidation?;neutral
No thanks my parents didn't raise any cowards.;negative
I work hard to get what I have and I ain't giving it up to anyone and that's final.;negative
This all sounds very heroic.;positive
I can almost hear Amazing Grace as I read it :P.;positive
The fact is that no matter how good a shooter you are there is still a chance of them shooting first when they see you have a gun.;negative
Its not worth risking it for the sake of money or 'honour'.;negative
Its difficult for me to relate to fully but I suppose its like in the UK, if someone comes into your house with a knife, then you pick up a knife and attack them.;negative
Its just something law enforcement would never advise risking your life that way.;negative
Where I live many law enforcement officials including the sheriff support privet ownership of firearms because they know the only one who can protect your home and family is you.;negative
And death is a risk I'm willing to take for you see there are two sources of oppression governments and criminals and I will die before I give in to oppression.;negative
Well thats very selfish of you.;neutral
You might be readily willing to give your life away but I'm sure you're family would not be.;negative
Selfish?;neutral
No selfish would be putting your property and family at risk because your too afraid to defend what you have.;negative
That's cowardly and selfish.;negative
Oh come on.;neutral
You know full well that when someone robs a place they don't want to kill people.;neutral
All they want is the money.;neutral
Its selfish to risk your own death and deprive your family of you.;neutral

The line between the good guys and the bad guys are always so clearly defined yes they are actually the guys doing bad things like threatening innocent people are the bad guys and the guys standing up to them are the good guys clear as can be.;negative
Exactly.;neutral
I guess you can always kill the bad guys after they've commited the crime too.;negative
Its helpful that you have public criminal records to make it easier to hunt them down.;neutral
That's the job of the police.;neutral
But it's best to stop the crime before the damage is done don't you agree?;negative
I can always stab someone in the neck .;negative
Good luck getting close enough to a criminal armed with a gun to do that.;negative
I just walk to you and kill you with knife, and I take your weapon and walk away over your cold corps....;negative
Not if I see you coming then all you get is a hollow point in the ass.;negative

In that passage, Gandhi references India’s Arms Act of 1878, which gave Europeans in India the right to carry firearms but prevented Indians from doing so, unless they were granted a license by the British colonial government.;negative
The full text of what he wrote is: “Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest.;negative
If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity.;negative
If the middle classes render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn.”;negative
These words come from a World War I recruitment pamphlet that Gandhi published in 1918, urging Indians to fight with their British colonial oppressors in the war, not against them.;negative
According to K.P. Nayar, chief diplomatic editor for The Telegraph in Calcutta, Gandhi saw “an opportunity for a political struggle against the colonial rulers and for the repeal of the unjust Arms Act,” not “for more Indians to have access to guns.”;negative
Peter Brock, a noted historian of nonviolence, wrote in his article “Gandhi’s Nonviolence and His War Service” that Gandhi “believed at that time (although he became more skeptical of this later on) that India could win equal partnership for itself within the British Empire if as large a number as possible of its able-bodied men volunteered to help the Empire, in one way or another, in times of need.”;negative
The British, that is, would regret passing the Arms Act because they’d discover Indians to be such valuable fellow soldiers.At this time, Gandhi was still a British loyalist.;negative
He hoped to encourage the British to repeal the Arms Act and grant India Home Rule within the British Empire.;positive
In his autobiography, Gandhi quotes a letter he wrote to the viceroy of India during the war, in which he declared, “I would make India offer all her able-bodied sons as a sacrifice to the Empire at its critical moment, and I know that India, by this very act, would become the most favoured partner in the Empire … I write this because I love the English nation, and I wish to evoke in every Indian the loyalty of Englishmen.”;negative
Gandhi wanted Indians to fight in World War I to prove themselves trustworthy with arms and fit for citizenship.;neutral
He was advocating for appeasement of India’s colonial rulers, not independence from them.;negative
Later, Gandhi’s thinking on this subject would change dramatically, but when he did initiate a campaign for full independence from the British Empire, he advocated only nonviolent means of resistance.;negative
Pro-gun activists frequently try to claim with that one, out-of-context sentence that Gandhi supported violence to defend oneself and others.;negative
"This is a vast oversimplification of Gandhi’s views.""";neutral
There was more to the article but I copied the part that put his words in context;neutral
I never insinuated that Ghandi supported violent ressistance.;negative
But he did realize that depriving people the use of arms is an evil thing to do as it endangers their lives.;negative
That's why he wanted it repealed that's why he encouraged the Indian people to help the British and gain there trust.;negative
Guns by themselves do nothing.;negative
They require human action good or bad.;negative
I'm guessing the multiple armed men were armed with guns.;positive
Yes but they were stopped by an armed citizen thus showing that you don't need to fear armed assailants so long as you yourself are armed.;negative
"As the saying goes ""god made man.";positive
"Sam Colt made man equal""";neutral
But not everyone can afford guns or lessons on how to use them.;negative
It would be fairer if there were no guns at all.;negative
It's like nuclear arms: it is unfair for only one country to have them, but it would be best if they were never created in the first place.;negative
(Countries being likened to people or social groups);neutral
Okay but how do you propose we get rid of all guns considering:Criminals won't register their guns, criminals can and do bye guns illegally through the black market, the black market is a world wide entity supplied by criminals, terrorists, and corrupt governments that would require untold amounts of money, global cooperation (as in every single government in the world no exceptions) to bring down.;negative
And sure we might have been better if guns were never invented or not we may never know and that's not what the focus of this debate is.;negative
And most hand guns don't cost more that maybe a couple hundred dollars.;negative
Less if you bye them online or from a privet citizen.;negative
And lesions are also usually quite affordable.;negative
If my brother a collage student working for minimum wage (plus tips) can afford a rifle than trust me most people can.;neutral
My point is that guns are as good as nuclear weapons.;positive
We only need them because other people have guns- this does not make guns a crime-stopping force for good.;negative
They are a neutral killing machine, like an assassin.;negative
(By the way, autocorrect has given you some funny typos);positive
But un fortunately the bad guy have guns and currently we have no way of changing that.;negative
So the best thing to do is make sure you are armed and ready to defend your self.;negative
It didn't stop the intruders from killing the shooter.;negative
No where in the article did it say that anyone other that the suspects died and if you go to the source article it says that no one was injured (other than the dead burglars of course.);neutral
P.s I down voted your argument because it made no sense.;negative
Every single person shot by weapon is a victim of a crime, so technically I't doesn't....;negative
Self defense is not a crime.;negative
so no not everyone shot by a gun is a victim.;negative
10,000 a year in US are ...;neutral
Is that the actual murder rate?;neutral
Of is that just the homicide rate?;neutral
If its the homicide rate then I challenge you to look up how many of those killings were classified as justifiable homicides (self defense) if its the actual murder rate I'm willing to bet you it's minute compared to our over all homicide rate.;neutral
Do you know what the number one killer in the US is?;neutral
Drunk driving should we ban cars too?;negative
After all by gun grabber logic they kill more people than guns (even though neither guns nor cars kill people its the people operating them but ssshhh you just ignore that part I wouldn't want to overload your brain);negative
"Yes it's a number of murders done by guns, please don't start with ""some of them could be blunted by weapon's stock or so""";positive
You know what's interesting?;neutral
According to the FBI the majority of gun murders are between criminals as in gang members shooting one-another interesting isn't it.;negative
That's a lot of criminals dead (contented sigh) beautiful sight.;negative
Still murders .;positive
But seeing as how they are being perpetrated by people who are already hardened criminals many of whom have felonious records and for whom firearms ownership is already illegal I don't see how a gun ban will do anything to prevent these murders.;negative
In countries were are weapons banned are illegal weapons very expensive, random freaks cannot afford them there are also many cops undercover so seller never knows to whom is he selling... it works that way in Japan.;negative
Or compromise like in Czech Republic.;neutral
If you pass trough screenings and pay for your training and licence you may get Class E and you can buy a handgun but you can have only standard ammo, no silencers, lasers etc.;negative
However if you harm anyone or forgot the weapon somewhere you will most likely end up in prison same if you get positive on booze or drugs.;neutral
Only really responsible people are capable of keeping weapons in long term...;negative
But such laws would hinder our right to keep and bare arms and according to the second amendment the government is not allowed to do that.;negative
Maybe you should not live in 18th century... or do you expect that British will come back?;neutral
:D;neutral
An amendment is an amendment whether it was from the 18th century or not.;negative
I wont deny however that much has changed since the 18th century but letting the government walk all over you and taking away your right to have a gun is wrong.;negative
not very inovative from you.;negative
.;neutral
oh and like your argument was any better?;negative
HA HA HA your argument is invalid more people die by slipping and falling in the tub.;negative
fix that before you try and take away my guns.;neutral
before you try and take away my guns redneck am I right :D;negative
Actually I know her in real life and no she's not exactly a red neck but she is more for republican party than she is democrat.;negative
isn't that pretty much a part of being redneck.;negative
?;neutral
part yes, fully no;neutral
Ha Ha Ha your argument is invalid.;negative
More people die by slipping and falling in the bath tub.;negative
Please fix that issue before you take away my guns.;negative
I remember you argument that guns does not kill people.;neutral
Now you are saying that they stop crime... You just use it whenever it fits to you.;neutral
In order for a gun to kill someone it has to be used to that end it cannot do that on its own.;negative
However the mere presence of a gun in the position of an intended target or bystander has been known to stop a crime from occurring so in a way guns by them selves (without being used) can and have prevented crimes.;neutral
In that case you may carry dummy gun .;neutral
Unless guns are illegal in which case the criminal might assume or know that you as a law abiding citizen wouldn't carry a real gun and if you were a criminal carrying a real gun you wouldn't carry it in such a fashion so as to have it clearly visible and deduce that it must be fake.;negative
Criminals may be dumb but they know their field as well as any professional (the successful ones anyway) besides what about in the situations in which you do have to use a gun?;negative
Works in Japan .....;positive
Japan also has a better education system, higher employment rate, virtually zero immigration and an honor based society.;negative
and thus fewer criminals than us.;neutral
So why not start building something like that ?;negative
Instead of giving weapons to random people.;neutral
Their society and culture was made over thousands of years.;negative
Sure fixing our education system and getting unemployment under control would help but for the other two things we would need to stop immigration (easy for them because they are an island not so for us) and adopt a completely new culture (and given un like the Japanese which share a common nationality and history america is so divers due to years of immigration we can't even decide on which language to use when wrighting signs seriously we have so many different cultures present in our country we make people with multiple personality disorder look normal so such a thing doesn't seem practical);negative
Immigration is good, just reduce the inbound of illiterate freaks .;positive
Immigration is fine illegal immigration and refusing to adapt to the already existing culture of the country you immigrating to is not.;negative
guns stop crime if you shoot someone that commits a crime but then your commiting a crime so does that mean you have to shoot yourself.;neutral
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral

I disagree if criminals get killed I consider that a great thing.;negative
yes they are actually the guys doing bad things like threatening innocent people are the bad guys and the guys standing up to them are the good guys clear as can be;negative

More people die every year in traffic accidents than from anything els in this country should then ban cars?;negative
I don't know how many times I hear this argument.;negative
As I have said to many other people this is NOT a valid response.;negative
And let me say on the side that traffic accidents are not the leading cause of deaths in this country.;negative
Here's a government document to prove that.;neutral
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm) Cars are not meant to kill.;negative
Where as, guns are meant to kill.;neutral
"You're right, there are so many more arguments in defense of guns that we can do away with that one ;)";positive
guns are dangerous...........;neutral
duh. . . I saw at the news that someone killed 11 elemantary school kids.;negative
Guns are only dangerous in the hands of people with mental problems.;negative
When a gun is utilized, it can be a very helpful tool to have.;negative
You can use them for hunting, to get food without spending allot of money, which is very helpful in the economy nowadays.;negative
Shooting targets is also a very fun sport.;positive
Its also a stress reliever.;positive
Guns are not a danger to the public, its the people who use them that are.;negative
you can do the same exact things with a bow except that a person with mental issues would not be able to mass murder school children as easily.;neutral
You can also do the same thing with a car.;neutral

Do you know how much more distance a gun has?;neutral
Do you know how much harder it is to get a clean kill on deer with a bow?;negative
Personally i don't want anything to suffer.;negative
Obviously you've never hunted before or you'd realize how useful of a tool it is.;negative
Everyone just assumes that every gun is going to be misused and will kill people.;negative
Even if guns get outlawed criminals will just get their guns through illegal manors.;neutral
Only law abiding citizens will be punished by this law.;negative

How about cars?;neutral

Guns are evil!;neutral

All the evidence says that if you are in possession of a firearm you are more likely to get shot.;negative
More likely.;neutral
Anyone who wants to justify owning an automatic weapon should pop over to Australia and see how well we get on without them.;negative
No-one has popped a cap anywhere around me or mine ever.;neutral
Thats right ever, no shootings to speak of and no armed robberies of my friends or family, ever.;negative
Though once the cat, or gat in this case, is out of the bag I am not sure you can put it away.;negative
Hard to see how the states could get all those guns back, so good luck champs.;positive
Nope.;neutral
There have been hundreds of thousands of cases in which people have defended themselves or others with guns.;negative
Look up this link below.;neutral
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1071444/;neutral
And comparing Australia with the United States is like comparing apples and oranges.;negative
The Australian government is a lot different than the one in the United States.;positive
You can't conclusively say that guns are the main factor.;neutral
><;neutral
1.;neutral
You linked a survey.;neutral
We all know gun advocates think they're Dirty Harry, find some police stats... you won't be able to.;negative
2.;neutral
The survey you linked is not about automatic firearms.;negative
Even if you are dirty Harry, it only takes one bullet to stop an intruder, not 100.;negative
As for comparisons, you can compare Australia becaue they have a similar socio-political make-up, which is the primary contributor to crime.;negative
Other countries with a similar socio-political make-up include the Scandinavian countries, Canada, England, and France - all of which show similar results with greater gun control laws.;negative
Now, you can argue the legitimacy of a handgun, hunting rifle, etc, and I would say it should be a local issue in each case (ie South Central Chicago might want different laws than rural Alabama).;negative
What you cannot do is say that having a oozi is self-protection.;negative
It is in the best case overkill, in the worst case a criminal who just has not been caught yet.;negative
Ok, for the sake of discussion, lets throw out the survey.;negative
Why is it so hard to believe being armed and knowing how to use your weapons effectively will make you safer?;negative
The reason you can't compare the United States and Australia on the subject of guns is because it won't produce clean results.;negative
In order to accurately compare or test a variable, the variable must be the only thing that changes.;negative
The United States and Australia have different laws and different governments, so it's impossible to derive a conclusive result about one variable.;neutral
Furthermore, the socio-political makeup is different in the United States.;neutral
Countries like Australia, Canada, England, and France all have a lot more socialism for instance.;positive
Part of my argument for this is common sense.;positive
If a criminal is lawless enough to use a weapon for malicious purposes, will he really care about the legality of his weapons?;negative
There's always a black market to turn to almost anywhere in the world.;positive
Also, guns aren't the only way violence can be carried out.;negative
If people really want to hurt other people, they'll find a way to do it.;negative
I agree with you that gun laws should be a local issue.;negative
In some cases, an automatic weapon is more effective than a semi auto for self defense (such as when several intruders break into a home at once, or when someone breaks in with armor).;negative
I know these cases are very rare, but they do happen occasionally.;positive
And when they do, an oozi is in fact a sensible choice.;negative
That's why the military uses automatic M-16s.;negative
A lot of things are common sense.;positive
The numbers show that one who owns a gun is far more likely to accidently shoot himself, or have a child who figures out a way to shoot themself, then to ever encounter an intruder.;negative
Home intrusions where the owner is home are less common than accidental shootings, that's a fact.;neutral
I have no problem with guns, in fact I like them.;negative
"I live though 2 blocks from the LV strip, and I would ""feel"" safer knowing it was hard for my neighbors to get their hands on a gun, than I would with one of my own.";negative
Very few gun control advocates advocate total gun control, that is a strawman the NRA made up.;negative
"Most gun control advocates simply want local municipalities to be allowed to look at the numbers and say ""okay, you can have a handgun but not an automatic"" in such and such a community, ""you can carry whatever you want in this community"" or if you're in the middle of the ghetto, maybe you can only own a hunting rifle.";negative
I see nothing wrong with this.;negative
The numbers show that one who owns a gun is far more likely to accidentally shoot himself, or have a child who figures out a way to shoot themself, then to ever encounter an intruder.;negative
Home intrusions where the owner is home are less common than accidental shootings, that's a fact.;neutral
I believe you will find, however, that the vast majority of accidental shootings are non-lethal.;negative
Intruders who break into an occupied home on the other hand, are likely to know the house is occupied, and come prepared with a weapon and have a conscious will to do damage.;negative
I'm actually a member of the NRA, and I have yet to hear from them that the feds will completely ban all guns.;positive
What they will do however, is take smaller steps on a slippery slope.;negative
"Things like bigger taxes on ammunition, a higher charge to obtain certain permits, bans on certain accessories, and even misleading legislation such as the ""assault rifle"" ban that would include many common hunting rifles.";negative
Neither do I.;neutral
But the problem is that it is a slippery slope.;negative
The general trend in the past has been to legislate with continually more restrictive laws, and they seldom get repealed.;negative
This is what has gun enthusiasts upset.;neutral
Trivial laws aren't so trivial when they continue to build up.;negative
And futhermore, who gets to decide what is reasonable?;negative
You may end up with a county of gun control extremeists who won't let you have anything, or you may have one that lets people have RPGs.;negative
It's a terrible idea.;negative
I mean seriously why would a regular person ever need a automatic firearm.;negative
I'm from Sweden and the only civilians allowed to own weapons are hunters and even they have a relatively hard time getting a weapon.;negative
A country can function just fine without regular people owning weapons.;neutral
Law abiding citizens is based on how they've acted SO FAR!;positive
Just because they have been law abiding for the time they have doesn't mean they always will be.;negative
Also, hunting accidents are common enough, if automatic weapons were in use, and a misfire or the like happened the effect could be much more extreme.;negative
Law abiding does not mean entirely responsible.;negative
Under that logic, we shouldn't allow anyone to have guns since they may one day snap and go on a shooting rampage.;negative
In fact, we really shouldn't even allow people to have cars since they may snap and mow down pedestrians, or ram a school bus.;negative
Come to think of it, we might as well just lock everyone up in padded cells so that no one can get hurt ever.;negative
Actually hunting accidents are very rare, and when they do happen, it is usually due to the elements, not a misfire.;positive
Furthermore, hunting with automatic weapons is illegal, unnecessary, and not the topic of this particular debate.;negative
There are many gun restrictions specific to hunting that don't apply for other types of shooting.;negative
It is impossible to ever be able to guage how responsible someone is 100%, and it will always be fraught with bias.;negative
That doesn't mean we should eliminate a right because there have been a few wing nuts out there.;negative
All citizens have been law abiding till the point where they break the rules - and even then, if they aren't caught they are still regarded as law abiding.;negative
"""Law abiding citizens"" means nothing as all wicked people have been a ""decent citizen"" (as noted by law) at some point prior to their crime(s).";negative
On the other hand, I do wish I could have a gun under my dress tucked into my stocking that I can whip out whenever a drunken ass approaches me.;negative
We can't have it both ways though can we?;negative
We don't know a bad man till he has given us a reason to think/know he is bad.;negative
For all you know, your neighbour could be a murderer/rapist, but he just hasn't been caught yet which means that at this moment he is considered by law to be a law abiding citizen, who, in the eyes of the people who picked no in this argument, is permitted to own a firearm.;negative
Fair?;neutral
Nope.;neutral
Because any law abiding citizen can have his mind snap and reach for that gun to kill another human being.;neutral
Not sure about whether or not it's a good or bad idea but, I'll tell ya, it is easily a fantastic form of entertainment.;positive
I dont think that is a bad idea.;negative
With the increase in crimes and security risks, individuals needs to protect themselves from harm.;negative
However i do think that the criminal history of the recepients should be examined to make sure they have a clean criminal background, that they are in good mental health and that they should be monitored on a regular basis.;negative
No.;neutral
An armed society is a polite society.;neutral
";)";neutral
We already trust law abiding citizens to own guns that will fire a bullet with every trigger pull.;negative
Why would it make that much of a difference if the gun fired continuous bullets?;negative
It only takes one bullet to kill, and currently, almost no one is using them in that fashion.;negative
The ones who do are getting them illegally, so selling automatic weapons legally wouldn't matter to them because they would get it from the black market anyways, not a sporting goods store or gun shop.;negative
So you want to legalize all drugs too, right?;negative
I mean, after all, if someone can't buy heroine from a supermarket, they're just going to go to the black market anyways.;negative
Nope.;neutral
There's a difference.;positive
Using drugs will screw up a person's mind and potentially make them do bad things.;negative
A gun will not.;neutral
It's simply a tool, not anything that will alter a person.;negative
Using a gun could screw up someone's mind.;negative
Absolute power corrupts absolutely, remember?;positive
But you are right, a gun is just a tool.;neutral
It is not dangerous, as long as the people holding it don't have evil intentions.;negative
And so making automatic weapons legal will decrease the amount people who have evil intentions and wish to have automatic weapons how?;negative
Cars have the power to kill people.;neutral
In fact, a lot more cars kill people than guns do.;neutral
Should we ban cars too?;neutral
What about kitchen knives?;neutral
Or tire irons?;neutral
Under you're premise, having a deadly tool can alter someone's mind, so we should get rid of them since they can kill people.;negative
And for your second point, most people who want guns for evil intentions don't buy them from a gun shop.;negative
"They buy them ""under the table"" so to speak.";neutral
The legality of weapons doesn't matter to a criminal.;negative
If they really want an automatic weapon, they'll find a way to get one.;negative
It makes no sense to bar them from our law abiding citizens.;negative
I just can't follow the leap in logic that if criminals have/will acquire automatic weapons, law abiding citizens need to have automatic weapons as well.;negative
There's just not really a logical purpose for an automatic weapon in a domestic environment.;negative
If criminals have more firepower than the law abiding citizen, it becomes a problem because it puts the potential victim at a disadvantage.;negative
There are many instances in which an automatic weapon would be more effective against multiple targets than a semi auto.;negative
Gang break-ins for instance.;neutral
Occasionally in gang related intrusions, several intruders may break in at a time.;negative
If they are grouped together, which they usually are, a full auto will take care of them quite nicely.;positive
What you are doing is making an (unreasonable, violent) solution to a problem that may be prevented from happening in the first place through other, better, nonviolent manners.;negative
You could have an alarm system for your house, you could have neighborhood watch-people, you could have a guard dog, you could help fund local school systems that will keep teens out of crime while simultaneously giving them an education.;negative
Instead of promoting a radical, deadly solution to these kinds of problems, try to use some common sense.;negative
You don't need to fight fire with fire.;negative
Sometimes water will do just fine.;positive
Alarms systems don't always run a criminal out of your house, and it often takes several minutes for police to respond.;negative
Neighborhood watches and school systems are ineffective in a similar fashion.;negative
They reduce the likelihood of a break in, but they don't help much once it's already happening.;negative
When it does happen and someone gets into your home with hostile intentions, the safest thing to do is to kill them.;negative
Preferably with a weapon effective for the task.;positive
First of all, denying individuals the access to firearms is not a good idea because they will still find illegal ways to posess weapons and this will be worst because in the legal format of owing weapons, the government can keep a registry of firearm owners and monitor them but in the illegal way, the government has no idea who owns firearms and this can cause a threat to society.;negative
Secondly, you cant deny anyone access to firearm because the 2nd ammendment itself does not prohibit giving firearms to civilians.;negative
If your standpoint of argument is the fact that firearms increases the level of criminality of civilians, then that argument in itself is a constitutional violation of the civilian rights based on the constitution on which this country was built.;negative
Thirdly, guns are needed for protection in areas that have a high crime rate.;neutral
A perfect example is a young father who i personally knew, and who was also a business man.;positive
He was robbed in front of his wife and children and then shot in the head and left to die.;negative
Take that for an example and imagine if he had access to a gun for his and his family protection, what would have happened.;neutral
Your entire argument is irrelevant.;negative
Your first point merely echoes my point about illegal/illicit drugs (why not legalize meth, crack, cocaine, and everything else because then the government can keep a registry of drug owners and monitor them but in the illegal way the government has no idea who owns drugs and this can cause a threat to society).;negative
See, you just substituted firearms for drugs.;negative
Secondly and most importantly, the debate is about automatic firearms.;positive
"Tell me where I ever wanted to take away your ""God-given"" second amendment (By the way, just to point out, who cares if it's in the Constitution.";negative
The Constitution is a man made document, and as such is fallible.;positive
That's why there are amendments like the second, and why the Negro is no longer 3/5 a person, and 18 year olds, women, and minorities can vote).;negative
An automatic weapon would have probably been more dangerous in this situation, especially since the criminal would have had a higher probability of owning an automatic weapon as well.;negative
First of all, meth and cocaine cannot be used in a case of self defense.;negative
The whole purpose of legalizing firearms is the fact that it can be used for the purpose of self defence when a person's life is in danger.;negative
No one has the right to own these types of substances because by law, they are illegal.;negative
Gun is an equipment and not a substance.;negative
Meth and cocaine are substances.;positive
What are the benefits of owning drugs in terms of saving your lives?;neutral
Can you use it to defend yourself?;neutral
Let me ask you this question, if you dont care about the constitution because it is man made then how come you care about the illegality of crack or meth?;negative
Didnt man- made laws made those substances illegal?;negative
The ammendments were made to the constitution because as we approached a liberal era, the people gained more rights.;negative
The whole purpose of the ammendments are to protect the people from the power of the government when used in an unfair manner.;positive
You should be thankful that the constitutional gave minorites and the women the right to vote.;negative
The constitution never prohibited in the whole, that right was added on to it to widen the rights of the people.;negative
If the father had access to a weapon, then his life would have been saved.;negative
What can be more dangerous than a father losing his life?;neutral
How much dangerous can it get?;negative
In reference to the Constitution, it is interesting how you fail to mention the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments which are directly amending the Constitution, not just adding things.;negative
Also, I would like to refer to you to George Carlin in reference to rights.;negative
"If something is a ""right,"" how is it possible that rights change with time?";positive
"Either it is a right, or it is not; it is not subject to the whims of the people, politicians, or populations.";negative
I believe in your right to self-defense.;neutral
"I don't believe in your ""right"" to an automatic weapon (especially when a normal, non-automatic gun would suffice).";negative
Perhaps the family gets hit in the crossfire.;positive
Or a witness.;neutral
Or anyone else besides the assailant and victim.;neutral
The 13th, 14th and 15th ammendment was made to the constitution to widen the rights of the people because governments could infringe upon the rights of the people.;negative
It is because of the constitution that we are protected in our homes or else the government could barge in and carry out unreasonable searches and seizures and then use that evidence to deprive us of life, liberty and property.;negative
Many people misinterpets the meaning of 'rights.';negative
It is not a right itself that changes overtime, it is we the people who give governments the power to take a right away from us because according to Howard Zinn, the government gets it power from the people and power and rights come from the people, not the government.;negative
Do you think the constitution was created by a government?;neutral
Whether you believe in the right to firearm or not is what your opinion is but majority of the population would agree that law abiding citizens have a right to firearms which is why the constitution permitting the use of firearms was never challenged.;negative
If you are saying that we should not give firearms to people because other people might get killed, then what you are implying is that we should take away the means from a person to protect themselves and let them die when we can provide them with the equipment that can save their lives.;negative
And by the way, majority of the crimes committed are committed by illegal gun posession and not legal gun posession.;negative
The 13th, 14th, and 15th ammendments were rights bestowed upon the people in the constituion and not changes made to the constitution.;negative
By whom?;neutral
Why is a negro no longer 3/5 a person, then?;negative
That was in the Constitution.;neutral
You are overlooking the basic, transient, flexible nature of the Constitution.;negative
Also, you are overlooking the ENTIRE premise of the debate: automatic weapons.;negative
"If you read the original constitution, you would see that it did not stated ""blacks are 3/5 of a person.""";negative
"What it sates is ""3/5 of all other persons"" because that portion of the constitution was referring to the population of the blacks.";negative
And also automatic weapons has no bearing on an argument prohibiting the use of civilians for self defence.;negative
It said that only 3/5 of the black population counted in representation for states, thus effectively making a black person worth 3/5.;negative
Regardless, this section was directly changed by the 14th Amendment.;neutral
I don't understand why you are arguing whether or not the Constitution has been changed.;negative
I'm saying automatic weapons are entirely superfluous if one wishes to protect him or herself.;negative
A small arm, or non-automatic weapon would suffice just fine.;negative
You said it yourself.;neutral
3/5 of the black population.;neutral
Thus, there is a difference between a black person or any type of person being the value of 3/5 of a person and 3/5 of a population.;negative
But anyway back to the argument.;neutral
I brought up the fact that the right to a firearm is within the constitution.;positive
You argued that the constitution is infallible or was changed.;neutral
So you are the one that raised the effectiveness of the constitution, not me.;negative
If a person chooses to have an automatic firearm or not, that is his decision, as long as he stays within the confine of the law because as a civilian, he has certain rights that the state cannot rid him of and the claim that owning a firearm is a potential for further criminality in a given population is a broad generalization in an argument without proper proof to prove so.;negative
Furthermore, if you are claiming that possession of gun leads to further criminality then i am surprised that your perception of small non automatic guns is different because gun in the whole can be a danger depending on how and where you use it.;negative
Your solution to a problem will have no effect on the problem at present if that is what you are proposing for a change.;negative
I don't think you understand math.;negative
Which one?;neutral
It can't be both.;neutral
I'm fairly certain I argued the Constitution has been changed, and your refusal to accept a basic understanding of history does not change history.;negative
Speaking of broad generalizations...;neutral
"I dont think you understand english enough to understand the difference between the words ""person"" as you claimed earlier and the term ""population.""";negative
Your argument is based on a phrase of the constitution which you yourself is not sure what the correct meaning of that phrase is.;negative
"If you were smart enough you would figure that when i was referring to ""certain rights"" i was referring to the 2nd ammendment.";negative
"You should probably check up the meaning of ""broad generalizations"" as well because it seems you have an issue in understanding the basics of english.";negative
The Constitution was not taking a census, you do realize.;negative
"They were saying that 3/5 of ""all other persons"" (i.e. slaves and other racial minorities) counted toward representation.";neutral
Thus, the 14th Amendment changed this and made every person count toward representation.;negative
Effectively, it legitmized the position of former slaves as full citizens, whereas before they were clearly not.;negative
And what I'm saying is these rights are not absolute.;negative
You do not get to own whatever you want whenever you want.;negative
You don't get to automatically own incredibly dangerous weapons.;negative
Or else why couldn't a citizen own a nuclear warhead, or why are there regulations on gun ownership like licensing?;neutral
"Now that you have taken a proper approach towards your argument, i do agree with you that they were referring to as blacks and other minorities including the native indians as well as ""3/5 of all other persons"" because the presence of the British was still influencing America at that point and the rise of Civil Rights Movements caused the blacks to be free from slavery through rebellion against the Dictators.";negative
However, at that point, the constitution was never reviewed and was recently created by the wealthy upper class white members of society who thought that their actions were wise.;neutral
Further review of the constitution lead to the institution of the 14th ammendment and due process clause.;negative
But as it is, the constitution has been reviewed for years and found to be appropiately fair not only by legislators but by several courts and human rights committee including the U.S Supreme Court.;negative
"If you recalled in my argument, i did not mention the term ""broad rights,"" instead i mentioned the term ""certain rights.""";negative
This certain right was referring to the the use of applicable firearms for self defence and automatic firearms were ruled to be liable for self defence.;negative
So, certain rights would extend to the use of automatic firearms for the use of self defence by civilians.;negative
And you said it yourself, the people's actions are limited by the government through the process of licensing, thus, through this process, the government gets to monitor the use of firearms by the civilian population.;negative
And thus the government may decide what is sufficient in order for civilians to defend themselves.;negative
I believe automatic weapons do not fall within that domain.;negative
If you believe automatic weapons do not fall within that domain then point to a specific clause stating or proving your point.;negative
What you believe is your opinion, not the fact.;negative
My argument is stated in previous entries.;neutral
Your argument is based on your opinion.;neutral
I dont need to hear your opinions.;negative
I need to hear your proof.;neutral
You said that the people's use of firearm is restricted, so if that truly is the case, then point to specific clause, stating so in any parts of the constitution or the bill of rights, since that is the ultimate source of rights.;negative
"And as we discussed, it is not really the Constitution that is the ""source of rights.""";negative
Rights may not be decided on the whim of a document or a people, otherwise then they're not rights, they're privileges.;negative
"Therefore, I only need prove that the ""rights"" given to us by the Constitution have ever been limited by actions from the government, to extend that as well to the 2nd Amendment.";negative
"Take free speech, which has often times been limited by the government (e.g. you cannot yell ""fire"" when there is in fact no fire) when it is deemed that said right may be dangerous for other civilians.";neutral
Similarly, the 2nd Amendment may be, and should be, limited in scope by restricting the general population from owning automatic firearms.;negative
Actually one is more likely to be involved in a homicide if one owns a gun, among a myriad of other statistics (see link).;negative
Additionally, countries with more restrictive gun control laws tend to have a higher homicide rate.;negative
Making guns more available, as well as increasing the firepower and killing power of a single weapon would dramatically increase one's susceptibility to violent crime via guns.;negative
The constitution is mot merely privileges, it is a source of rights.;negative
"Point out one phrase in the constitution that mentions the terms ""privileges.""";neutral
"However you will find many of the terms listed as being ""rights.""";neutral
You claim that rights have not been decided merely on the basis of a document but bear in mind rights were decided by the U.S Supreme Court on the every document that we should refer as being the constitution of the United States.;negative
The rights guaranteed in the constitution cannot be limited unless one trespasses the limits of these constitutional rights which are no longer protected by the government.;negative
Yelling fire in a crowd when there is no fire is not free speech as you claim because according to the law, it produces a bad result definitely, since it can cause panic and can even cause injury because people might try to escape in panic.;negative
In some instances, yelling fire in a crowd when there is no fire in a building can cause people to block up the exit leading to a depletion of oxyen which can result in people dying.;negative
Therefore, this is not a right as you claim.;negative
This is an act of crime that can result in severe danger or death to others.;neutral
"If i recall you stated in your argument that ""the 2nd Amendment MAY be, and SHOULD be.""";negative
"The words ""may"" and ""should"" illustrates that not even you yourself is certain in whether your perception of this issue is actually factual or just opinionated.";positive
Furthermore, weapons in the whole can increase a person's susceptibility to commit violent crimes but if that is true then:;neutral
A) That includes and covers the possession and ownership of small guns as well so they should also be banned and;positive
B) How come the crime rate for LEGAL OWNERS of firearms has been significantly lower than that of the crime rate for ILLEGAL FIREARM OWNERS?;negative
"You misunderstand my problem with so-called ""rights.""";negative
I am saying rights (fundamental, universal, human) are not granted via a document or Supreme Court ruling.;negative
These rights would include liberty, pursuit of happiness, and equality.;negative
These are vague constructs, yet seem to be morally appropriate to guarantee to all human beings, and thus are rights of all human beings.;negative
The constitution attempts to distinguish specific ways to achieve these various UNIVERSAL rights, and thus they are limited in their focus and intent.;negative
That is why I would rather not speak of the Bill of Rights or the Constitution as a way of measuring a right but rather a privilege.;negative
And thus you contradict yourself in one sentence.;neutral
How can they not be limited, and yet still have limits, which trespassing those limits results in the creation of limits?;negative
My example of yelling fire in a crowd was a perfect example of even how freedom of speech (i.e. to say what you will when you will) is limited for the benefit of the majority.;negative
Thus we may place similar restrictions on other rights to benefit the majority.;negative
"Additionally ""may"" merely reflected the observation that the 2nd Amendment has been limited before, and ""should"" reflected my opinion that it should be.";positive
I'm sorry, your analysis of simple language mechanics is faulty, and it appears you seem to be grasping at straws.;negative
No, they should be restricted.;neutral
"Like any policy, there is a ""sweet spot"" of regulation and freedom.";positive
"Too much regulation and people no longer have the ""right"" and too little and it is nearing anarchy.";negative
Currently, it appears to me that gun laws are much too lax, and should be strengthened.;negative
Do you see how I provided actual, factual statistics?;negative
Do you see how you have not?;neutral
First of all, prove to me that righ5ts are not granted via document or court ruling.;negative
The U.S Supreme Court has not granted any civilians rights but they have interpreted the rights available in the constitution and prohibit the government from violating these rights.;negative
If the Supreme Court and any document which you are claiming was not the source of rights, then why were various case laws made from these sources and why was the government prohibited from passing laws that would violate the constitutional rights of civilians.;negative
If i recall, the Supreme Court has dealt with various cases regarding racial bias, due process, 4 th amendment searches and seizures as well as racial stereotyping.;negative
The Court ruled in all these cases that due process and equality has been denied in these cases and therefore these people were freed because the source of their rights, the constitutional rights were violated.;negative
A privilege is something that you can take away whereas rights are something you cannot take from a citizen.;negative
Again, you seem to be having a hard time in understanding the technicality of my perception.;negative
How can you call the commission of a crime as a right?;neutral
If one does something that produces a bad result and can endanger other lives, how can you refer to that as being a right or privilege?;negative
What you are referring to is not freedom of speech.;negative
That is referred to as a crime.;negative
There is a difference between something that we enjoy as a right but does not protect us from committing crimes.;positive
For example, the freedom of speech also extends to actions, meaning that we have a right to display our actions, so lets assume that i have a right to free speech, does that mean i can go and burn down buildings or killing people to get my message across because i have a right to free speech?;positive
Again, your example is a crime and not a right.;negative
You should read up on what adds up to a right and a crime respectively.;neutral
"If i was in a debate in court and used the term ""MAY"" people would assume i myself am not sure of the point i am trying to get across.";negative
That proves that you are not certain if what you are saying is the truth or you think it might be true or not true what you are saying.;positive
My analysis of simple language is based on the language you put forth so don't blame me for observing for what is put forth in front of me.;negative
"Let me give you an example, if cops arrive on a scene to arrest a person and the person is suspected of being in a building so the cops approach you and ask you if he is in the building or not and you respond by saying ""MAYBE"" then that means that you are not sure but you think he might be.";negative
You see the difference between certainty and uncertainty and how words illustrate our inner opinions or may contradict our points?;neutral
I think you are failing to realize or accept that restrictions will have no effect on guns.;negative
These people need to be monitored.;negative
What evidence have you provided?;neutral
Factual evidence from the FBI?;neutral
Which is responsible for collecting and storing records of crime?;negative
Our perceptions of rights differ in my definition is an absolute, i.e. rights exist regardless of documents, and yours are relative, i.e. a document provides them and thus are limited by those who are governed by those documents.;negative
Does that clear up the matter?;neutral
"I said, ""You may pass me the cheese now,"" quite obviously I am not having uncertainty over whether or not I will receive cheese, I am merely being polite and saying you are physically allowed to pass me the cheese.";negative
I believe I was referring to restricting the second amendment in this way, i.e. we are allowed to limit/regulate that right.;negative
And thus, you completely ignored my simple request.;negative
I did provide several studies (though embedded in an article).;neutral
And for someone who has such little faith in government (after all, we need all the guns we can get to protect ourselves from their tyranny), you would still trust their studies?;negative
(http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/homicide/weapons.cfm);neutral
(http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/tables/firearmnonfataltab.cfm);neutral
Are those enough trends?;neutral
I think you are misunderstanding the perception of what importance that document serves.;neutral
You are forgetting that since we do not get our rights from the government, there needs to be a document which is the ultimate source of rights that serves the purpose of preventing the government from infringing upon our rights since government tends to act in conflict to the interests of its people.;negative
Let me remind you that when this constitution was created back then, it first had to be approved by the people before it could become effective and to this day, it still is accepted and approved by the majority of the population.;negative
You are failing to understand that there is a difference between what you referred to as being a crime and what is actually a right.;negative
How can we have a right to commit a crime when the example you gave is clearly a crime?;neutral
Governments are not limiting our rights because the right you are referring to is not a right but rather a crime, therefore that cannot be found in the source of rights because it is a violation of the laws.;negative
If you said to me that you MAY pass me the cheese, you used the term MAY because you are not certain if i will.;negative
If you used the term PLEASE, then you are displaying a sign of politeness.;negative
Finally, i did take a look at those statistics you sent to me and there is one major problem that i observed.;negative
Why is it that your graph fails to point out what proportion of these crimes were committed by legal or illegal firearm holders?;negative
As far as i am concerned, all these crimes could have been committed by illegal firearm holders because the graph itself fails to refer if these gun crimes were committed by illegal and or legal firearm holders, thus the proof you sent me still do not justify the point you are trying to make.;negative
I am surprised that you questioned my faith in a government by trusting their statistics when your argument illustrates a low level of faith in the government, but yet at the same time, you are using government statistics.;negative
And like i mentioned, your studies make no distinctions of gun crimes committed by illegal and legal firearm holders so how are we supposed to figure out which category makes up the larger portion of those crimes committed?;negative
I'm saying that the whims of the majority do not guarantee, grant, or deny anyone rights.;negative
Thus, neither does the document.;negative
Rights are an intrinsic aspect of an existence.;neutral
"You may not say, ""Oh, I don't like him, so I'm going to write a document and get it approved by the governing force to take away his rights.""";negative
Do you recognize how ridiculous that is?;negative
Please, give this up.;neutral
This is a very small straw you're grasping at.;negative
Focus on substantive parts of my argument.;positive
How about a quote:;neutral
"""In the 1992-93 Kansas City experiment, a number of police officers in the inner city of Kansas City were put specifically and entirely on the duty of searching for and eliminating illegal firearms.";negative
This heightened crackdown took place over a period of 29 weeks, after which results were studied and compared with those of the first, unchanged 29 weeks.;negative
"After the 29 weeks of heightened activity against illegal firearms, the rates of gun crimes in the part of the city monitored decreased significantly, by almost 50%, whereas the ""control"" section of the city, in which a crackdown on illegal guns was not enforced, experienced no change in its crime rate.""";negative
Quite obviously, if police crack down on illegal firearms, and gun crime rate decreases by almost 50%, you see that most gun crime is committed by illegal firearms.;negative
That is why it stands to reason that by making more powerful guns more readily available, crime rate would probably be increased because criminals would have much greater access to much more powerful weapons.;negative
Please, read the site i provided earlier: http://www.guninformation.org/;neutral
Also, it appears that yet again, I am the only one providing a factual, statistical backup for my responses.;negative
It amazes me that you seem to be having a hard time to grasp the point i am trying to make.;negative
If the rights come from the people, then it takes majority of the people to put that right into effect.;positive
Rights do not just come from anywhere, they come from the people.;negative
"One senior prosecutor examined your argument last night and told me to ask you, if you do not need a document to prove that you have rights, then how come you need a document to prove in a court of law that you are innocent when you are already innocent and also said that you should point to any specific part of the constitution that states the term ""privileges.""";negative
Why would the people write a document to take away somebody else rights when the same rights that they have created for themselves would apply to all citizens of that country.;negative
Do you know how ridiculous that argument sounds?;negative
If there was a crack down on illegal firearms, then that points out to the fact that if government monitors the using of firearms by civilians then the level of firearm crimes will decrease.;negative
This is a form of monitoring in which certain requirements are not met, so the government seizes hold of that firearm until the requirements are met.;negative
If most gun crimes are committed by illegal firearm holders then it means that legal ownership of firearms combined with government monitoring can have a positive effect.;negative
The site that you provided me with seems to be lacking impartiality since it seems to be biased.;negative
At the beginning of the site, the author did not post his name (i wonder why nor the date the information was last updated or published) and because of his bias and lack of impartiality, any information obtained would be biased since he is obtaining information to satisfy his level of bias.;negative
In all of his argument or evidence, he introduced sources who were biased to gun rights which leads me to wonder why did he not introduce sources favorable to gun rights and then produce counter sources to counter act the point made by those sources?;negative
Secondly, some of the sources were from religious sources which is an issue since sources that are religious in nature would tend to mix religion with logic.;neutral
Thirdly, some of the results in the research were conducted in different countries, which is unacceptable for me to read since you cannot in any way compare a country to the United States because there can be more than one factor that can be causing the gun crime rate there and also there is a difference in the size of the country and the population as well as social issues.;negative
"""Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz have found that as many as 400,000 people per year use guns in situations in which they later claimed that the gun almost saved their lives.";negative

, pg.;neutral
70);neutral
Also the source of the problem is illegal firearm ownership because according to the National Crime Victimization Center, illegal firearms are used in about 20 percent of robberies, 10 percent of assaults and 5 percent of rapes.;negative
Therefore, if you outlaw automatic guns criminals will still have access to these guns because there are still gangs who have access to these guns and can sell them to earn a profit.;negative
"""Banning the use of firearms will lead to that gun having more value which can lead to an increased trafficking in gun as well as other illegal substances (Siegel, Criminology: Theories, patterns and typologies 10th Ed.";negative

So what you're saying is rights are decided by a majority?;negative
You have the freedom of speech because a bunch of people voted that people should be allowed to speak there mind?;neutral
Does that not also imply that rights may be taken away in a similar manner?;negative
"Therefore, that ""right"" is not so much a right in that it is yours no matter what as much as it is a privilege granted to you by a population.";neutral
I am saying rights are absolutes, transient of any human document.;negative
You're saying rights are fabrications of a human society and thus vary not just from place to place but person to person as well.;negative
I do not understand how a document is proof.;negative
A document proves something has happened before.;positive
It does not physically allow or disallow you to do things.;negative
A document really has no power beyond the power people place in it.;negative
It doesn't.;negative
I'm just disputing your concept of what is a right.;positive
That was the entire point.;neutral
Your entire argument was based on the efficiency of government monitoring and thus being able to crackdown on illegal firearms (I think.;negative

This argument is actually addressed by a Harvard professor of Health Policy, David Hemenway.;neutral
He states:;neutral
"""Since a small percentage of people may report virtually anything on a telephone survey, there are serious risks of overestimation in using such surveys to measure rare events.";negative
The problem becomes particularly severe when the issue has even a remote possibility of positive social desirability response bias.;negative
Consider the responses to a national random-digit-dial telephone survey of over 1500 adults conducted in May 1994 by ABC News and the Washington Post.;negative
[34] One question asked: 'Have you yourself ever seen anything that you believe was a spacecraft from another planet?';negative
[Page 1438] Ten percent of respondents answered in the affirmative.;negative
These 150 individuals were then asked, 'Have you personally ever been in contact with aliens from another planet or not?';negative
and 6% answered 'Yes.;neutral
'By extrapolating to the national population, we might conclude that almost 20 million Americans have seen spacecraft from another planet, and over a million have been in personal contact with aliens from other planets.;negative
"That more than a million Americans had contact with aliens would be incredible news--but not the kind actively publicized by reputable scientists.""";negative
Yes of course, and you aren't either?;negative
And what exactly is your basis to say that religious people would falsify data or conduct irresponsible surveys?;neutral
You imply that religious people are illogical (or that the two are mutually exclusive) but I have met very many religious people who are exceptionally logical.;negative
Actually, it would be ILLOGICAL to come to the conclusion that there is absolutely no way religion is right about (a) god(s), as it is simply impossible for either side to prove existence or nonexistence.;negative
Therefore, to assume that religious people are illogical would be itself a logical fallacy.;negative
Yes of course, you may not compare other countries to the US when talking about guns, except of course when it's the countries with low crime rates and low gun control.;negative
And making guns more available will actually have the opposite effect, right?;positive
Making automatic weapons cheap and readily available will completely disincentivize ownership of automatic weapons.;negative
Rights have always been decided by the majority because it takes the cooperation of the majority to put it into effect.;neutral
But anyway since we both agree that rights exist but we disagree on the sources of rights i will address that.;negative
Th constitution is a document that was written and preserved and handed down from one generation to the next.;negative
It is a living proof that we are protected by rights which guarantees protection from the government.;negative
Before that constitution, was created, majority of the people voted for it to be put into effect.;negative
If you don't believe that rights come from the majority then how come laws are created with the approval of majority of the population?;negative
How come before we can over throw a government, majority of the votes from the population needs to outweigh the minor?;negative
How come when a Supreme or Appellate Courts decides a case, it takes majority of the votes to make a decision in that case?;negative
The human society was and is constructed in such a way that the larger population decides what is a right and hardly have they taken away a right from somebody else.;negative
Didn't majority of the population voted for certain actions to be labelled criminal, so would you say that is unfair because majority of the population took away the right from another civilian to commit a crime?;negative
That is the very reason why a document has power, because it is made up of the power THE PEOPLE gave it that power which serves as a proof against governmental infringement of our rights.;negative
Furthermore, at that time the constitution was created, there was no opposition to it from the people.;negative
"I am surprise you were arguing earlier that the constitution is privileged but yet in the same document you are disputing you cannot point to one specific word pointing to privilege meanwhile at the same time you will find many amendment such as the 4th amendment beginning with ""the right of the people.""";negative
"It is interesting that you do not see ""certain rights"" as related to the 2 amendment as i am explaining and repeating myself for the 3rd time which goes back that firearms CANNOT be restricted to people especially since it is designed in a way that is useful for self defense (Automatic firearm).";neutral
If you don't understand government monitoring to be legal ownership then i advise you to put your critical thinking skills to work before responding to an argument.;negative
Your argument and the evidence you introduced is weak.;negative
The source i introduced is a source that is valid and is being used by all schools offering law and pre-law countrywide.;negative
Moreover, the author of that textbook is the chairperson of John Jay School of Criminal Justice as well as a professor at many other law schools.;negative
He is also a criminologist and one of the most recognized authors.;negative
Secondly, how do you know that these surveys were completed via telephone?;neutral
How do you know that these researchers were not representing a government funded research?;neutral
I see no point in a rebuttal that has nothing to do with the source i have introduced.;negative
He said that he would like to introduce information pertaining to gun control and introduced sources which were from religious sources and other sources that all demonstrated campaigns against firearm rights in general.;negative
Why did you not answer the part where i asked you why he did not introduced statistics from the supporter researches of gun rights and why does he fail to mention his name?;negative
We are in a debate but he is introducing factual information, thus there is a difference between my method of debating and his method of presenting information.;negative
Sources that are religious tend to produce bias information because their emotions prevents them from accepting logical information in terms of issues pertaining to social structure.;negative
I did not in any way mentioned they are illogical or logical.;negative
My point i am trying to establish is that they have a religious view on certain logical issues that causes them to produce information to satisfy their logic.;negative
Take abortion and prostitution as examples.;neutral
Also if you recall my point i said MIX RELIGION WITH LOGIC.;negative
What part of that statement points to what you are illustrating?;neutral
Low crime rates can be the result of better social structure and not just low gun rate.;negative
It could be the result of a smaller population and better availability of education and jobs.;negative
These are all issues pertaining to crime so hence, your argument is merely opinionated rather than factual.;negative
The point that you are failing to understand that illegal firearms will contribute to more people owning guns illegally without the government having any knowledge thereof and can cause a increase in crime.;negative
Therefore the best form of system is a system of monitoring firearms users, not restrict them.;positive
I can essentially ignore the rest of your argument and point out one specific point:;negative
Firstly, of course my argument is opinionated.;negative
That is what an argument is.;neutral
"It is based on facts (and you calling them ""weak"" simply because the other did not provide you facts that you would like to have used does not negate that he does in fact present facts).";negative
Secondly, yes, your argument about those issues all pertaining to crime is entirely valid.;negative
So why then can you say that if we were to have automatic weapons, we would be safer?;negative
Countries with legal automatic weapons would have different demographics.;negative
Various states have various demographics where perhaps an automatic weapon would be beneficial, as do counties, cities and neighborhoods.;negative
You must recognize that we must be able to compare a very broad swath of humanity (the US is a big place) and say that for the majority of places in the US, automatic weapons would not provide enough of a benefit to outweigh their risks.;neutral
Eh, I can't resist the rest of your argument.;negative
Well, most of it.;neutral
I feel we should limit our discussion to the discussion of automatic weapons and thus eliminate our discussion of where rights originate as it has grown quite off topic.;negative
I'll make a separate debate for it if you wish.;neutral
I don't not understand your argument, it is just the phrasing and syntax is quite amorphous.;negative
And my refutation of that source was a man named David Hemenway, a professor of Health Policy at the Harvard school of Public Health, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, among other titles related to the field of public health.;negative
I would posit he is a reliable source.;negative
"This is how I know, ""We use the most anonymous possible national survey format, the anonymous random digit dialed telephone survey.""";negative

And thus they are illogical.;negative
I'm sorry, but that is what you are saying, and I find it incredibly narrow-minded to dismiss a survey (not an interpretation of a survey, but the survey itself) based on the fact that it was conducted by a religious organization.;negative
That would be okay, but to introduce information that supports gun control?;neutral
Off with his head!;neutral
The point is, yes, if you bothered to read any of the rest of the site, you would notice that quite obviously the author is a gun control advocate.;negative
However, that does not dismiss the information he presented.;neutral
Information is information.;neutral
Your first sentence is perhaps the most circular argument I've heard: illegal firearms will cause more people to own guns illegal because they will be illegal if people own them.;negative
Obviously.;neutral
However, you fail to understand that if you make automatic weapons legal (and all weapons apparently.;neutral
"You say earlier in your argument suddenly that you are advocating a complete lack of restrictions on firearms, ""firearms CANNOT be restricted to people,"" although I believe we had previously discussed how it was necessary to restrict gun activities from various groups of people-like insane people or criminals-or to make it necessary for government regulation of the gun market.";negative
This seems like a frightening prospect, much more so than a restriction of automatic weapons.);negative
, the pool of automatic weapons will in fact enlarge, and more people will own them, and the weapons will be more accessible by those who may have been hesitant about ownership simply because of their illegal nature.;negative
Suddenly, it would seem more acceptable to rob a convenience store with an automatic weapon versus a handgun or a knife.;negative
Saying that having a small pool of automatic weapons leads to a greater number of people having automatic weapons is quite illogical.;negative
unfortunately, automatic weapons were not designed for self defense, and I am not entirely sure where you pulled this misinformation from.;negative
I have here the patent for automatic arms.;neutral
"http://www.google.com/patents?id=MigTAAAAEBAJ&printsec;=abstract&zoom;=4&source;=gbs_overview_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;=a&f;=false";neutral
It was designed by a military brigadier, so as to reduce reload times, and kill more enemy soldiers.;negative
and here is the source stating that owning a gun increases the likelihood of getting shot.;negative
http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed.html;neutral
I do agree that illegal firearm use is a more pressing issue than legal firearm use- yet this discussion is over automatic firearms, which is entirely unnecessary for self defense.;negative
Should a gun be needed, a rifle, pistol, or shotgun are more than necessary.;negative
Why take the unnecessary risk of using an uzi to shoot in self defense?;negative
Throwing civilians at a criminal?;negative
Grabbing civilians by the legs and swinging them like a baseball bat?;negative
I might question the effectiveness of such.;neutral
I deeply apologize for the error in my argument.;negative
I meant the use of firearms for self defence.;neutral
I was at the time, multi tasking so i am sorry about the error in my statement.;negative
This is not so.;negative
Meth and cocaine cannot be used in a positive way since they will always cause bodily harm.;negative
Guns on the other hand, can be used for hunting and protection.;negative
The point being made was that banning guns won't help the potential victims.;negative
Criminals seldom obtain their guns by legal means.;positive
Do you shoot moose with machine guns?;neutral
Do you need an AK for protecting yourself from muggers?;neutral
Where have I said anything about banning guns.;neutral
"Take your guns, fine, you may have that ""right.""";positive
That does not, however, give you the right to fire any kind of weaponry you want.;negative
If you want to take this back to the founders, they would be appalled at the way people abuse the Second Amendment in order to justify owning frivolous (for civilians) arms.;negative
The worst they had were muskets (inaccurate at that) and canons (more so) that came no where near the deadly force of even a handgun today.;negative
Hunting with automatic weapons is illegal in the United States and unsportsmanlike besides.;negative
Although if a bear is charging at you, it would be good to have an automatic .45 to kill it before it kills you.;negative
And automatic weapons are much more effective than semi-autos to eliminate multiple or armored targets (such as gang break-ins, or an intruder with a bullet proof vest).;negative
They most certainly would not.;neutral
Every one of them thoroughly understood the importance of having an armed citizenry, and they encouraged the ownership of guns as much as they could.;positive
Without the strong prevalence of firearms in early America, they could have never succeeded in their revolution, and without the continuation of armed citizens, the government could obtain absolute power and oppress the people.;negative
But the important part was the fact that weapons were evenly matched.;negative
People could still kill each other with firearms, and often did in the revolution.;negative
Thousands upon thousands of people met their fate at the end of a gun making the gun violence of today a drop in the bucket (despite the fact that they are more advanced).;negative
Everyone was well aware of their lethal potential, and yet they were encouraged anyways because when a society is armed, citizens are much more reluctant to commit a crime and governments are much more reluctant to oppress the people.;positive
Yes, shooting an automatic weapon in a domestic area sounds like a fine idea.;negative
It's similar to gassing a house with a family in it in order to kill some ants.;neutral
At least you killed all the ants, right?;neutral
You don't think that's a strawman argument?;neutral
Here's what happens with weapons: http://www.jahonline.org/article/1054-139X(95)00030-V/abstract 00030-V/abstract);neutral
Education, on the other hand, is almost universally acknowledged as the best way for people to influence their government (without bloody revolution).;negative
An in fact, those with a low education are more likely to commit crimes (http://www.fightcrime.org/sites/default/files/reports/MI%20Cops%20and%20Tots_0.pdf);negative
So would it not make more sense for people to invest more energy and money in the education effort rather than the armament effort?;negative
Do you realize that break-ins aren't always a one man job?;negative
And do you also know that some intruders wear body armor?;negative
Automatic weapons are more effective against such targets.;negative
No, because it has happened in the past.;neutral
Also, that was one of the main reasons the founders encouraged people to be armed.;negative
Allowing citizens to own automatic weapons doesn't necessitate a draw on government resources.;negative
There's really no way I can argue with you.;negative
"Yes, shooting a spray of bullets at ""enemies"" will be more efficient than taking the time to individually shoot each person, but that does not necessitate owning automatic weapons.";negative
Jesus christ, please stay on topic, this is getting exhausting.;negative
I earlier said, keep your arms.;neutral
I'm not asking to deprive you of all guns, merely automatic.;negative
This is a rather good site: http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcassaul.html;positive
It says that .2% (1/5 of 1%) of violent crimes are perpetrated with assault weapons (even using their broad definition).;negative
Therefore, to claim that you need an automatic weapon to defend you and your family against these hordes of automatic-weapon-bearing criminals is simply ludicrous.;negative
No, but the billions (to trillions worldwide) of money spent on arming ourself with firearms could largely be used more efficiently spent on better educating a nation.;neutral
When someone (or multiple people) break into your house, seconds count.;negative
Especially when the intruders are armed.;neutral
How about shotguns?;neutral
or pistols?;neutral
"They kill people just as well as an ""assault rifle"" and most are a lot cheaper.";positive
And no, you probably wont ever encounter a situation in which you NEED an automatic.;negative
Just like you will probably never NEED to use a concealed weapon for your own defense.;negative
But the point is that it's better to be allowed to have it on the chance that the need arises.;negative
Sure it could.;neutral
But making laws that decide where private sector money goes is called socialism.;negative
And socialism won't work in this country.;negative
There is literally no point in arguing this.;negative
"It is not so much you have convinced me of anything, or I feel like you make valid points, so much as it is that you are so entrenched in your ideas of why one should be able to carry deadly weapons and inflict deadly harm on someone at any time that I cannot even hope to ""win"" the debate.";negative
Also, this debate is entirely unrelated to socialism.;negative
First of all to blindly follow your US constitution in modern days is ridicules because times and ways of life change.;negative
And to answer your exiting question the rest of the family might have been shot as well.;negative
Why do you follow the laws that were created 100s of years ago?;negative
Arent they man made?;neutral
And to respond to you, those childre n are orhans now because their father was killed not able to defend himself.;negative
Even though the children saw their father killed, at a distance they saw him being shot they could not have been injured.;neutral
I do follow laws but laws are updated often enough to make most of them make sense.;neutral
The US constitution is old and could use updating just like any other set of laws.;negative
It's true that it would complicated to revoke peoples right to bear arms but if it would be done It would be for the better.;negative
And I apologize if I upset you with my answer to your question regarding the family but what I meant was that the situation could have been escalated to a far more dangerous situation should the father have pulled a gun on the robber.;negative
The father would like any other normal person have been slightly hesitant about shooting someone.;negative
It most certainly would not be for the better, and I believe you underestimate American attachment to their gun rights.;negative
There are several million gun owners here, and if the right to bear arms was revoked, there would almost certainly be a civil war.;negative
Especially considering the fact that most of the armed services would likely side with gun owners.;neutral
Most gun owners (in the US anyways) are quite competent with their firearms, and I can tell you from experience, the hesitation doesn't happen when you or your family is in danger.;positive
I agree with you.;positive
Banning the use of firearms on civilians would most certainly introduce a new civil war in society and more damage to the society than one could imagine.;negative
Because if a right is taken awasy from them, then they will see it as a form of dictatorship and hence try to rebel since it is a right granted to them by the constitution.;positive
Not only would it create a civil war but the crime rate will also go up because the illegal firearm owners will now have the upper hand on choosing and attacking their potential victims.;negative
By revoking peoples right to bare arms I didn't mean that the government is to swoop down and forcefully collect everybody's guns, I was thinking of something a bit more gradual like perhaps starting with putting up restrictions to make it more difficult to buy a gun.;negative
And on the second point I sincerely hope that all Americans aren't so hardened and cold that they could without even a second of hesitation pull out a gun and immediately shoot someone.;positive
To believe that any regular person no matter the country could easily gun down an other person is delusional.;negative
I'm not trying to be offensive and I understand that there are people that would have an easier time shooting someone than others but the reality is that most people would hesitate even for only the briefest moment and that moment can be vital to what happens next.;negative
Then the conflict would only be delayed.;neutral
There would be continually more public unrest and protesting until it eventually became violent just as it would be if they were confiscated.;negative
I speak from experience on this particular topic, and it's not something that anyone wants to be faced with.;positive
But there are times when a person must protect himself and his family because he has a duty to them and to himself.;positive
Even if that means killing the attacker.;neutral
First of all, most of the laws are updated because of the constitution.;neutral
In most of the instances, government might create or already have a law that is infringing upon the rights of the people so when a person is incacerated because of the vagueness, ex post facto or inefficient law, the Supreme Court has to interpret the Constitution and then apply it to update the law.;negative
There are so many case laws that were created from the constitution and so many laws created by legislators were striked down because it was seen as a violation of civilian rights when interpreted by the constitution.;negative
Do you think, that if we are in a emergency, we can always depend on police officers to save us?;negative
Do you think that if i call 911, and there is a man holding a gun, and the cops take appromixately 15 mins to arrive, between the scope of that 15 minuites, i will be begging for my life and defenseless infront of my perpretator only for the cop to arrive and then find my dead body.;negative
As it is, many laws are already favorable to the defendant and what you are proposing is a law favorable to the defendant because the victim is not allowed to carry a weapon but at the same time, the defendant will still carry a weapon even if it is illegal for the sole purpose of robbing someone or killing someone.;negative
I agree with you that maybe the situation could have escalated but how do you know that it could have?;negative
Are you certain or just making a presumption?;neutral
How come in many other cases, people that uses gun for self defence dont end up injuring other members of their families in the process of defending themselves.;negative
Take for example the Connecticut murders that took place recently, in which the father was tied up, beaten, wife and two daughters killed in which one of the daughter was raped infront of the family before she was killed.;negative
Dont you think that if the father or mature family member had access to a weapon, all this could have been prevented?;negative
Or are you going to say that somebody else could have been hurt?;neutral
Cause the entire family with the exception of the father died.;negative
I agree with you on many of your points and in present day America changing the policy on guns would be extremely difficult but you must agree with me when I say that a country functions better without such an abundance of guns.;neutral
And I also agree that the incident in Connecticut could have most certainly been prevented should one of them had access to a gun.;negative
I still stand by my belief that a country should in any case function better and be safer in the long run without such free access to guns.;negative
I do not agree with you that a country can run better without the abundance of guns.;negative
I believe you are under the presumption that anyone can have acess to a gun.;neutral
Not anyone however can have access to a gun so in other words, access to guns are not free.;negative
It is limited because there are other factors that helps to determine who is better suited for a gun.;negative
These factors includes criminal history or any mental evaluation and furthermore, the government keeps a registry for firearm holders and monitor their use by also requiring them to renew their registration yearly.;negative
That is a shame because crime wise many countries are functioning better.;negative
You cant compare one country to another when there is a difference in the sizes of the population as well as other social factors which can be responsible for one effect.;negative
I fear that I might have been unclear you see I accidentally strayed from the subject but I only wonder if you honestly believe that in the future America will have truly benefited from your current weapon policy.;negative
And you are correct the US can't be seen as one country when it comes to laws but gradually change the approach to guns in individual states.;neutral
I admit its a bit naive of me to think that your entire country wouldn't be pissed about one of there rights.;negative
I want you to think past the inevitable impact of removing a right and think of the benefits afterwards granted that you aren't launched into a civil war in which case you'd be screwed.;negative
Its ok to stray off topic sometimes to establish your point.;positive
How can we know if this country will benefit from that policy until you give them a chance to put it into effect.;neutral
And like i would have mentioned earlier in my argument, the use of firearms in the home for self defence has helped to save many lives in the past and majority of the crimes committed are committed by illegal firearm holders.;negative
This should be a clear indicator that legal ownership of guns in no way has increased potential criminality for law abiding citizens.;negative
I strongly think that if you remove that rights and lets assume that a civil war occurs.;negative
Now lets think past that, dont you think the civil war will cause the economy as well as the social structure of this country to collapse and plunge us into a new era of severe depression?;negative
The key word is law abiding citizen.;negative
Law abiding citizens are not criminals, therefore, they have no reason to use these weapons unless for self defense of oneself or others.;negative
Are you saying that by being a law-abiding citizen, it becomes impossible to have accidents involving guns?;negative
Because as far as I know following the law does not make one an a sharp shooter capable of hitting ones attacker and nothing else.;negative
All the evidence says that if you are in possession of a firearm you are more likely to get shot.;negative
More likely.;neutral
Very few gun control advocates advocate total gun control, that is a strawman the NRA made up.;negative
"Most gun control advocates simply want local municipalities to be allowed to look at the numbers and say ""okay, you can have a handgun but not an automatic"" in such and such a community, ""you can carry whatever you want in this community"" or if you're in the middle of the ghetto, maybe you can only own a hunting rifle.";negative
I see nothing wrong with this.;negative
Law abiding citizens is based on how they've acted SO FAR!;positive
Just because they have been law abiding for the time they have doesn't mean they always will be.;negative
Also, hunting accidents are common enough, if automatic weapons were in use, and a misfire or the like happened the effect could be much more extreme.;negative
Law abiding does not mean entirely responsible.;negative
A perfect example is a young father who i personally knew, and who was also a business man.;positive
He was robbed in front of his wife and children and then shot in the head and left to die.;negative
Take that for an example and imagine if he had access to a gun for his and his family protection, what would have happened.;neutral
What can be more dangerous than a father losing his life?;neutral
How much dangerous can it get?;negative
rights bestowed upon the people;neutral
changes made to the constitution.;neutral
3/5 of the black population.;neutral
Thus, there is a difference between a black person or any type of person being the value of 3/5 of a person and 3/5 of a population;neutral
You argued that the constitution is infallible or was changed;neutral
If a person chooses to have an automatic firearm or not, that is his decision, as long as he stays within the confine of the law because as a civilian, he has certain rights that the state cannot rid him of;negative
"If you were smart enough you would figure that when i was referring to ""certain rights"" i was referring to the 2nd ammendment.";negative
the government gets to monitor the use of firearms by the civilian population.;negative
that is the ultimate source of rights.;neutral
The rights guaranteed in the constitution cannot be limited unless one trespasses the limits of these constitutional rights;negative
That includes and covers the possession and ownership of small guns as well so they should also be banned;positive
How come the crime rate for LEGAL OWNERS of firearms has been significantly lower than that of the crime rate for ILLEGAL FIREARM OWNERS?;neutral
I think you are failing to realize or accept that restrictions will have no effect on guns.;negative
These people need to be monitored.;negative
What evidence have you provided?;neutral
Factual evidence from the FBI?;neutral
Which is responsible for collecting and storing records of crime?;negative
it first had to be approved by the people before it could become effective and to this day, it still is accepted and approved by the majority of the population.;negative
If you said to me that you MAY pass me the cheese, you used the term MAY because you are not certain if i will.;negative
If you used the term PLEASE, then you are displaying a sign of politeness.;negative
"point to any specific part of the constitution that states the term ""privileges.""";negative
Do you know how ridiculous that argument sounds?;negative
legal ownership of firearms combined with government monitoring;neutral
he is obtaining information to satisfy his level of bias;negative
Secondly, some of the sources were from religious sources which is an issue since sources that are religious in nature would tend to mix religion with logic.;neutral
which is unacceptable for me to read since you cannot in any way compare a country to the United States because there can be more than one factor that can be causing the gun crime rate there and also there is a difference in the size of the country and the population as well as social issues.;negative
Therefore, if you outlaw automatic guns criminals will still have access to these guns because there are still gangs who have access to these guns and can sell them to earn a profit.;negative
Low crime rates can be the result of better social structure and not just low gun rate.;negative
It could be the result of a smaller population and better availability of education and jobs.;negative
These are all issues pertaining to crime so hence, your argument is merely opinionated rather than factual.;negative
If you don't understand government monitoring to be legal ownership then i advise you to put your critical thinking skills to work before responding to an argument.;negative
The source i introduced is a source that is valid and is being used by all schools offering law and pre-law countrywide.;negative
Moreover, the author of that textbook is the chairperson of John Jay School of Criminal Justice as well as a professor at many other law schools.;negative
Secondly, how do you know that these surveys were completed via telephone?;neutral
How do you know that these researchers were not representing a government funded research?;neutral
My point i am trying to establish is that they have a religious view on certain logical issues that causes them to produce information to satisfy their logic.;negative
he did not introduced statistics from the supporter researches of gun rights;negative
The point that you are failing to understand that illegal firearms will contribute to more people owning guns illegally without the government having any knowledge thereof and can cause a increase in crime.;negative
prohibiting the use of civilians for self defence.;neutral
Your first point merely echoes my point about illegal/illicit drugs (why not legalize meth, crack, cocaine, and everything else because then the government can keep a registry of drug owners and monitor them but in the illegal way the government has no idea who owns drugs and this can cause a threat to society).;negative
See, you just substituted firearms for drugs.;negative
An automatic weapon would have probably been more dangerous in this situation, especially since the criminal would have had a higher probability of owning an automatic weapon as well.;negative
Guns on the other hand, can be used for hunting and protection.;negative
banning guns won't help the potential victims;neutral
Do you shoot moose with machine guns?;neutral
Do you need an AK for protecting yourself from muggers?;neutral

This seems to be a textbook example of the misleading vividness fallacy.;negative
This is purely anecdotal evidence.;positive
Of the 13,000 gun deaths every year, this encompasses 12.;negative
But that said, I seriously believe that assault weapons need to be studied on a much wider scale to determine their effect on crime.;negative
The fact that a) guns like AR15's are free to public purchase b) were obtained 100% legally and fairly quickly by the shooter (Holmes) is incredibly disturbing.;negative
Guns like the AR15, combat grade assault rifles, have one purpose.;negative
Not self-defense, not hunting, these weapons are used for slaughtering people.;negative
Why they are available to the public is beyond me.;negative
You could give me the constitution argument and say people need them because one day the government is going to take over everyone and everything and mass murder all American or some crazy sh*t like that.;negative
Or you could contradict the laws of supply and demand by saying criminals will get their hands on them anyway and the supply will stay the same/increase as criminals increase.;neutral
Handguns and CC liscenses prevent crime and save lives.;negative
That is empirically proven.;neutral
What hasn't been proven and is beyond theoretical reasoning are deadly assault weapons.;negative
Assault weapon crimes did go down under the ban imposed until 2004 when it was allowed to expire.;negative
I have seen no substantial evidence that more assault weapons and less crime have a positive, causative correlation.;negative
You could give me the constitution argument and say people need them because one day the government is going to take over everyone and everything and mass murder all American or some crazy shit like that.;negative
The Second Amendment is not a prediction, it is a protection from Tyrants taking away our means of staying in power.;negative
The idea that it's okay to expand the military and police while greatly limiting the deadly power of the citizenship is the basis for an authoritarian regime.;negative
Tyrannical regimes have existed throughout history and continue to exist this very day.;positive
"There is no reason to believe that the States or Britain are excluded just because they have ""Democracy.""";negative
The States ensured this with the Second Amendment.;neutral
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!?;neutral
Thank you, I was going to say the same thing.;negative
You and prayerFails give me hope that America can be all that I think it can be and greater than the founding father could have imagined.;neutral
"You have already been ""taken over"" by the government.";negative
You are controlled in every aspect of your life so why do you continue the argument of a tyrannical government?;neutral
The US was not established as a democracy, but a constitutional republic which is governed by the golden rule....he who has the gold makes the rules.;negative
If you think that in todays US the government NEEDS to have its soldiers knocking on your door you are sadly mistaken.;negative
The second amendment was put into place at the time in case of invasion by foreign country (since we didnt own the country sea to sea) and has no practical use in todays society.;negative
I doubt a bunch of hillbillies with guns is going to be much protection should the U.S. military decide suddenly to take over the country.;negative
And would that very unlikely scenario apply at all to a voluntary military made up of said citizens?;negative
Under what circumstances would either we need to protect ourselves from the military (we couldn't) or under what circumstances would our military be overpowered by another and we'd need guns to defend from this new enemy?;negative
Seems a fantasy.;neutral
If anything guns are the illusion of safety from that perspective, they wouldn't actually do much good should one of these things happen.;negative

It doesn't have to be regime versus citizens, it's a destruction of itself.;negative

There are so many factors to it that when you say stuff like that it makes me realize how comfortable and diluted you are.;positive
No worries, a revolution isn't likely right now.;negative
However, why not protection from the police?;neutral
Refer back to the Black Panthers.;neutral
Most of my statements already point out how your dilute the entire argument to only one or two possible scenarios.;negative
Yet they will do much good for many other thins, such as self-defense from any kind of intruder (including the police).;negative
Given that police already use unnecessary force and that history shows any government can get corrupt id say it is possible, the simple thought that because we have US implanted in front of our names alone excludes us from the possible chance of ever having a day where civs will have to protect themselves against anyone is in itself a fantasy land.;negative
Men are corrupt, not goverment.;neutral

"""Assault"" rifles are functionally no different from any other magazine-fed hunter's rifle.";negative
The only difference is cosmetic.;neutral
Restrictions on them encompass firearms including but not limited to those having pistol grips, suppressors or folding stocks.;negative

Switch out the stock for something wooden and suddenly it's a civilian gun.;negative
"The AR-15 Holmes used was not an assault rifle; it was your plain old everyday boilerplate semi-automatic no different from the average hunting rifle.";negative
To say its only purpose is to kill people is patently false.;negative
The guy could've used a Hello Kitty .223 and caused the same devastation.;negative
Very true.;positive
I've, at times, fired an AR-15 for target practice.;negative
"It's ""devastation"" is not very apparent.";negative
People seem to act like mass murders, so far, would not exist if assault rifles didn't exist.;negative
However, most mass murders are done with hand guns and explosives.;neutral
The statistics of gun deaths in America compared to countries where we aren't allowed to run around waving guns in the air alone is enough to clinch the argument for me.;negative
I don't believe in banning guns, but I believe in the basic right of humans to not get shot at, which trumps the right of humans to shoot at people.;negative
In a country like mine where guns are quite stringently controlled, you can freely use guns, but only for non violent purposes.;negative
If you have a problem with only being allowed to use guns in a non violent way, then clearly the only reason for that is you want guns to be used in a violent way, which violates the right of other people to protection against violence.;negative
Murder and assault is illegal virtually everywhere.;negative
--------------------------------------------------------;neutral
Your first sentence is an exaggeration, well our regulations could be different and more effective, that doesn't translate to more stringent gun control.;positive
We could be like Switzerland, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland .;negative
For assault rifles, yes.;negative
For handguns, arguably.;neutral
There is no reason to have an assault rifle other than to kill other humans in an efficient, yet large scale manner, that you cannot do with any other gun.;negative
Hunting, personal defense, you can do that with a rifle, or a handgun.;negative
The only advantage of an assault rifle is to shoot lots of people quickly, something that I see no gain to society in having freely available.;negative
Yes, it is entirely possible that someone in the audience would have been carrying a handgun, were all gun control laws abolished, and that peoples lives could have been saved.;negative
But the simplest way to help save lives is to ban assault rifles in all cases.;negative
Not only does that mean restricting their access (completely) to the public, but it means active efforts on behalf of the police force to restrict criminals access to ARs.;negative
In countries like England, with very strict gun laws, it is possible to have a hunting rifle, especially if you live in the countryside, where hunting is much more common.;negative
However, there is a significantly lower rate of gun crime, and there is virtually no assault rifles available to anyone (it's a non-issue currently).;negative
Only through preventing access to all, not just through legal methods of purchase, will crime be reduced - the main aim of gun control laws.;negative

Selective use of data & fails to come even close to convincingly show causation.;negative
Massive lack of statistics.;negative
In both countries, guns are banned in target rich areas, so it's logical that gunners would still try and target these areas.;negative
It shows little towards causality, and the causation is easily explained.;negative
It's also worth remembering that Europe is much larger than the US, in terms of population, so that hardly surprises me.;neutral
Yes, there's violent crime, but not gun crime.;negative
Inner London especially has a significant amount of gang warfare.;neutral
However, this is mostly done with knives, rather than guns.;neutral
This is almost certainly due to the fact that guns are so hard to come by.;negative
The comparison is also quite ridiculous, as in SA, in places like Joburg, there is a massive amount of violent crime, much more than anywhere in England, yet a very small amount of it is reported, because it is so commonplace.;negative
So I hold little faith in that article.;negative
Assault rifles are low- or mid-caliber weapons, designed to fire controllably on full-auto, for engagement ranges of less than 500m, or less than 100m for primary effectiveness.;negative
They have been effectively banned in the US since 1934.;negative
Assault weapons, as put forth in the 1994 ban, do not have a meaningful definition (see post above).;negative
The advantage of an assault weapon over a handgun is massive.;negative
Bigger bullets, much more deadly, 30 in a clip rather than 7, a semi auto rifle is massively more dangerous than a handgun.;negative
So I still feel that any rifle but a hunting rifle should be banned (hunting rifles have more recoil, less bullets, and massive scopes - much less effective from close range, which is the typical range of mass murders).;negative
Yet, despite all that, handgun homicides consistently outstrip every other gun used in a homicide by at least 2 to 1.;negative
Would you support a ban of handguns exclusively?;neutral
Now compare the number of handguns to other guns, and I'm sure it'll be more than 2:1.;positive
And yep, I would.;negative
I don't agree with the argument that the people should be able to overthrow the government with weapons (peaceful protest is the way to go for me), so only hunting rifles are good for me.;negative
And even that should be heavily regulated.;negative
But, I'm not going to debate that.;negative
I'm sure that worked out great for those living under Castro, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol'Pot', Chavez, and King George.;negative
You're right: the most common are shotguns, which are involved in gun crime very rarely.;negative
But what does that have to do with anything?;neutral
"We're talking about the practical damage of firearms; it doesn't make sense to ban one type because of its prevalence only unless your only goal is to punish law-abiding gun-owners rather than criminals.";negative
Incidentally, your country tried the handgun-ban in '97.;negative
Handgun crime increased.;neutral
Well, that's a matter of personal preference, but it's a pretty integral part of our Constitution, so you'd have to argue against that.;positive
I can see why you wouldn't want to do that.;negative
"Of course, people just go waltzing down the streets, shooting people because ""they felt threatened"" (genuine law in some states) and of course innocent people are going to be killed.";negative
But no, trigger happy Charlton Heston is too blind to see this.;negative
If we all go around carrying guns more people are going to be MURDERED!;neutral
You might think it's 'cool' to walk around with a weapon, but there're a lot of weirdo's out there who think it's OK to kill people.;negative
Give them a firearm ... Not good!;positive
I think we need to go with one extreme or the other.;neutral
Either everyone is educated and carrying guns, or all guns are banned.;negative
This middle ground we're on doesn't seem to be working.;negative
Personally, I feel that if we're going to have guns, then they should be as common as cars, and treated similarly.;negative
I think everyone should require a gun license, which would be similar to a driver's license in almost every way.;negative
It would be a valid picture ID, it would require satisfactory completion of gun safety and competence courses as well as written and performance based tests, and would have to be renewed periodically.;negative
It should also be as inconvenient not to own a gun or license as it is not to own a car or driver's license.;negative
If as many people had firearms and firearm licenses as have cars and driver's licenses, events such as this recent tragedy would be fewer and further between, in my opinion.;negative
In theory I see what you are saying but more practically it would be a useless gesture.;negative
I car license just says you are supposed to understand the basics of firearms usage.;negative
How often does someone get a drivers license who does not have the slightest idea how to use a car other than the pedal on the right makes it go.;negative
Think how easy it is to get a drivers license and ask yourself is that going to make any difference when someone decides to do something terrible.;negative
I agree, the standards for obtaining a driver's license are too lax.;negative
One drive around town clearly demonstrates this lol.;negative
Sill, I'd prefer lax standards to no standards.;negative
If filling out some registration forms, and passing a criminal background check was all one needed to do in order to own and operate a vehicle, I'd bet the roads would be far more hazardous.;negative
guns are for the governments military and for the police not for ordinary citizens;neutral
Tell that to our Founding Fathers.;neutral
Gun control of the strictest denomination is needed.;negative
There is too much gun violence in America.;negative
No, it is the exact the opposite, the right to life means private protection of one's own life, and the one way is open carry of weapon.;negative
More gun control will only put more guns in criminals and take out weapons of law abiding citizens.;negative
So all the children who were injured/murdered in the Theatre were supposed to have guns of their own, or else they wouldn't have died?;negative
The right to life means the right to live, not the right to kill.;positive
The right to not get shot at trumps the right to shoot people.;positive
If someone is threatening another person's life, he has every right to kill in the name of protection.;negative
This is standard police protocol, therefore, it should be every private individuals as well.;negative
Standard police protocol in America anyway.;neutral
In Britain we prefer less barbaric methods of crime control.;neutral
And doesn't what you've just said contradict your libertarian philosophy in terms of being anti death penalty?;negative
Because giving people the right to shoot criminals is allowing the death penalty for crimes.;negative
You can defend yourself without killing people.;negative
Use a taser if you're really that paranoid.;negative
Apparently, the Britians are so much more civilized than Americans.;negative
Actually, Libertarians dont agree universally on everything.;negative
Using force against force is not the death penalty considering it is defending one's own life.;negative
As a human being, it is an right to defend my life if threanted by danger.;positive
Death penalty is a legal term.;neutral
Using a handgun doesnt always translate into death just as using a tazer doesnt always mean nondeadly.;negative
The exact opposite would be forcing people to carry guns.;negative
Which would be as much, or more I'd argue, a violation of other's rights than limiting the type of weapon one can carry.;negative
"So not ""opposite.""";negative
Okay.;neutral
But you're arguing guns in general, not controlling the type of guns.;negative
You're inflating the opposite position to fit your argument against it better.;negative
You can protect yourself (well, psychologically feel like your protecting yourself) with a handgun... with a tazer actually as someone below points out.;neutral
Why would they then get more guns?;negative
Seems they'd have the same at most.;negative
Less more likely since they'd be more difficult to get at the least.;negative
No, it would take assault and semi-automatic weapons out of the hands of both law abiding citizens and psychotics.;neutral
Sure, drug dealers and whatnot might have as many, or a few less of these guns I'd guess, they'd still have them though, sure.;negative
You aren't going to protect yourself from this element of crime though.;negative
That is what police are for.;neutral
Who won't have these types of guns though are psychos like this guy and people who commit spur of the moment crimes.;neutral
Restrictions on gun ownership would push more guns into the Black Market.;negative
The same happened with Prostitution.;neutral
Prostitution was safe and available to all legal citizens before it was made illegal.;negative
Most prostitutes were managed by Madams.;neutral
Once prostitution was pushed into the Black Market, madams practically disappeared and Pimps took over.;negative
Guns in the legal market are to the discretion of the County, State, and Merchant.;neutral
Gun control (yet not gun BANS) is Constitutional at the State level, so long as legal citizens are not barred from being able to carry guns.;negative
This keeps the gun flow regulated without any real regulation, because even States with little to no gun control keep firearms at the discretion of merchants, whom often times choose their customers.;negative
but the tighter the restrictions on purchasing weapons, the more guns get pushed into the Black Market.;negative
Either by stealing or by importing illegally.;neutral
This keeps guns out of the hands of legal citizens and into the hands of criminals.;neutral
The only way to limit guns for criminals (yet eliminating them will be impossible) is to have a Nation wide ban on guns and much tighter control on our borders since many illegal firearms come from south of the border.;negative
This calls for much greater border patrol.;neutral
As well, you create a much higher demand for criminal organizations to either steal weaponry or work more with the Cartel to bring in more guns.;positive
"Criminals don't just say ""no guns?";negative
"oh well.""";neutral
If their operation requires guns, they will get them.;negative
As for killers like John Holmes, while a Nation wide ban on guns may prevent him from shooting up the theater, it won't stop him from killing the people he wants to kill.;negative
John Holmes wired his apartment with explosives, and it's not unlikely that he would have used explosives in the theater if he couldn't use guns.;negative
That would have, ironically, probably killed more.;negative
In fact, the worst school massacre in US history was by explosives.;negative
Mass Murderers are truly the only sort of good argument against guns, yet most have not even used assault rifles.;negative
John Holmes used an AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle, as assface pointed out, that is no different from a hunting rifle.;negative
I've fired guns at a firing range and one of them included an AR-15.;negative
it is deadly, but not the Rambo type shit you're thinking of.;negative
The ideal way to look at gun control is that it's possible to stop things like this.;positive
But the reality is that really... it isn't.;negative
The exact opposite of gun control is not forcing people to carry guns, it would actually imply the freedom to purchase and carry a weapon at one's choice.;positive
Gun control implies restricting the sale and carry of weapons.;negative
The government has no authority to force people to carry guns.;negative
No type of gun should be controlled.;negative
If someone wants an automatic weapon, they will get it via the black market at the right price.;positive
Are you really that stupid?;negative
It is called the black market.;neutral
This is like saying how did people get alcohol during prohibition.;neutral
"""It seems they'd have the same at most, maybe less more likely since they'd be more difficult to get at the least.""";negative
You are an idiot.;neutral
Psychos will get weapons no matter what either at WalMart or black market.;negative
I am not worried about the mafia or drug dealers because I don't get myself involved with them and they are not worried about me.;negative
It appears that the police doesn't either.;negative
The government is constantly brided by the mafia and drug dealers to stay off the territory or they will have a city war.;negative
The person who committed the shooting bought all his guns and ammunition legally.;neutral
you dont think law abiding citizens can go violent ithink anyone having a really bad day could lose it....;negative
i think law abiding citizens can go violent to and giving anyone a gun is stupid;negative
I say we ban alcohol and Tobacco first then the humans.haha Funny how Marijuana is not on the list.;negative

One wouldn't wait for the theater to fill up with gas before shooting and as for the body armor... shoot him in the face;negative
And, to have made a headshot on a guy in the middle of a dark cinema (and have been able to predict the filling of the cinema with gaseous substance and make it before then) would have been miraculous.;positive
Speaking as a marksman, I know that I wouldn't have fired my weapon if it was as dark, hazy, and chaotic as people have described.;negative

The mainstream media has ignored witness testimony of an accomplice who tossed a flair/smoke grenade from the opposite end of the cinema to the arrested man.;negative

Obama has made several statements about gun control in the past.;negative
Something tells me this arrested man is a patsy who has been framed for the shooting all in the name of gun control arguments.;negative
Why would the US gov do this you ask?;negative
Because they fear the US economy will eventually collapse, and an armed public will be much harder to control.;negative
Nope, because the people who misuse guns the most are the ones who are already doing illegal things.;neutral
Gun control won't do anything but make it more difficult for those who aren't doing anything wrong but want guns.;negative
Like me :(;neutral
And that guy was so random...;neutral
No, there a tons of gun control laws and you can add a ton more but it won't solve anything.;negative
What disgusts me about this issue is that 12 people died and their families lives were ruined forever, but of course, people have to try and use this as leverage to support their view, have some respect.;negative

You could argue that with less control people could carry a concealed weapon and take these people out before they cause too much damage.;negative
I want to make that argument but realistically it wouldn't make that much of a difference.;positive
If that city in colorado allowed people to do whatever they want with guns it still would have went down the same way.;negative
It's unrealistic to think that John Wayne would have poped out of the audience and saved the day.;negative
Regardless of what laws of restriction or security or laws of allowance, it all comes down to the fact that if people want to kill people they can.;negative
There's always a way to kill.;positive
So weather you're for or against gun control you know deep down that it wont make much of a difference.;negative
It seems that many have died.;negative
yup, many have died.;negative
There is enough control already;negative
Its easy to shoot people in the face, in the body, in the legs and blablabla if there is tear gas.;negative
Oh god I'm crying for some reason;negative
We don't need gun control, we need some bullet control.;negative
Bullets should cost $5000 each, so if a policeman finds a guy with 18 bullets in him, he'll know that he must've done something to deserve it.;negative
There will be no more school shootings or anything else, because people can't afford to pop Mr. Carmichael in the head.;negative
Well i believe at a time when threatened it would be conviniant to have a gun in ur pocket.;neutral
That said i do believe u should have a legal license for those things because that's when people start going crazy.;negative
Also there are other ways to protect yourself like self-defense classes, tazors, even small little pocket knifes can be handy sometimes!;negative
If a person wants to shoot people that badly a few gun laws or more gun control is not going to stop them.;negative
It is all about the human mind and human nature.;positive
Laws are merely guidelines, which we can easily break at anytime.;negative
If we try to break one we are not going to be electrocuted by some imaginary zapper before we pull off the crime.;negative
We can break the laws anytime we choose to.;negative
"Besides are criminals who break the law by killing people already going to follow more less serious laws then ""though shall not kill""??";negative
I don't think blaming it on gun control is the answer to this issue.;negative
Let's say gun control is increased and he possibly could not get a gun.;negative
Would it have been any less horrifying if he went to the theater with a homemade explosive device?;negative
Caused a fire in the building causing people to stampede out of the theater trampling each other to get safe.;neutral
(Horrifying imagery would you not say) If someone is determined to harm that the medium in which they employ becomes secondary to the mechanics of it.;negative
Restricting gun control will not prevent such things as this from happening.;negative
The difference between owning a gun for home defense and going on a rampage is the owner.;neutral
You want to make sure the owner is mentally competent to own the weapon that is fine but just be prepared then for the next shooter to be described by his peers as friendly, never caused, and quiet.;negative
Wait, don't we hear that a lot of times already.;negative
The Aurora shooting, while indeed a tragedy, is not sufficient reasoning for greater levels of gun control, as it falls under the fallacy of misleading vividness.;negative
The fact remains that a mass shooting like the incident in question is an exceptional event, an exceptional circumstance, one which leads to exceptional, or hastily generalized, conclusions.;negative
The hasty conclusion here is the position that gun control should be increased.;negative
Further, the idea of increasing gun control hinges on the concept that such a restriction of freedom is justified in the first place--which I maintain it is not.;negative
The mere act of owning a gun is not an immediate and active harm to someone else.;negative
According to, for example, the Non-Aggression Principle, such ownership is always allowed or justified, because it is not done in direct coercion, extortion, or deception, of another.;negative
Simply put: the violence is already restricted and deemed wrong.;negative
There is therefore no reason that the gun should be as well.;negative
People have probably said it but i will.;neutral
Guns don't kill people we do!;neutral
If say the government banned guns today, 1.;neutral
How the fuck would they get them all?;negative
2.;neutral
Killers would still use knifes rocks and cars or just beat them to death!;negative
By no means am I trying to be insensitive, but I don't see why this particular event should cause any specific concern that the other thousands of gun homicides do.;negative
I do think the way he obtained the weapons and ammunition is a bit concerning.;neutral
There shouldn't be easy online access to any kind of deadly weapon.;negative
This is really all that needs to be thought about following this tragedy, the Second Ammendment is not at fault here.;negative
I doubt a bunch of hillbillies with guns is going to be much protection should the U.S. military decide suddenly to take over the country.;negative
And would that very unlikely scenario apply at all to a voluntary military made up of said citizens?;negative
Under what circumstances would either we need to protect ourselves from the military (we couldn't);neutral
under what circumstances would our military be overpowered by another and we'd need guns to defend from this new enemy?;negative

You've proven my point for like the third time.;negative
Texas had a militia, which was regulated.;neutral
A regulated militia before they even were annexed.;negative
And they were annexed as a result of the Mexican-American war.;negative
Could Texas be its own state?;negative
Sure, and they'd suck a little less then Mexico maybe.;negative
But this is way off subject.;neutral
The point is the purpose of assault rifles.;negative
There is nothing compelling about any of the revolutions mentioned which anyone could reason were an excuse to allow whoever whatever gun they want.;positive
There is no case where any group similar to current gun nuts, did any good to any society they have ever dwelled within.;negative
No, your twisting it to try to avoid being proven wrong.;negative
1.;neutral
The militia was created into an army.;neutral
2.;neutral
Texas actually requested for statehood, but they were refused at first because of their debt.;negative
3.;neutral
Annexation was not a result of the Mexican-American War.;negative
Texas became independent before that War, so please read a history book.;positive
You can't even get your own country's history right.;negative
4.;neutral
You can thank the gun-owner over history for retaining our independence.;negative
No one has ever, nor wanted to, invade the United States.;negative
So the justification is right there.;positive
It is a good protector and preventer.;positive
5.;neutral
Once you understand and get our history right, then I'll talk.;positive
Showing your ignorance in our own history is a bad image for you.;negative
If you don't know that, why should I listen to the ignorance your spewing?;negative
Not to mention propaganda modern society has happened to throw on you.;negative
I believe I am attacked because I am.;negative
You justify it under the guise of the common good, saving lives, and ridding violence from the world.;negative
News Flash.;neutral
It won't work.;neutral
It will still go on, even if you disarm me.;negative
Violence is in human nature.;positive
Disarming the good wont stop the bad.;negative
It will only cover it up for a while.;neutral
It will come back stronger, and with vengeance.;positive
The man who strikes first admits that his ideas have given out.;neutral
~Chinese Proverb;neutral
You have struck first.;neutral
All violence is the result of people tricking themselves into believing that their pain derives from other people and that consequently those people deserve to be punished.;negative
~Marshall Rosenberg;neutral
Why Am I being punished?;negative
I did nothing wrong!;negative
The psycho did.;neutral
Fix the psychos.;neutral
Not the innocent bystander.;neutral
Punishing me is like executing someone for a murder he didn't commit.;negative
Stop punishing me so you can get the false sense of security a gun ban will bring.;negative
Oh, and please read a history book.;positive
Inaccuracy is a pet peeve of mine.;negative
:);neutral
1.;neutral
Correct;neutral
2.;neutral
True.;neutral
3.;neutral
I know.;neutral
They were independent for a time.;neutral
Then as a result, one of the results, of the Mexican American war, they became a state.;neutral
So far so good.;positive
4.;neutral
Uh... no.;negative
You can thank the U.S. military, early in the country the help of France and Spain.;positive
Now, it was people with guns who fought of the English, but they were trained, they became a militia.;negative
They weren't even allowed to take the firearms home in most instances.;negative
Most states decided against that.;neutral
It certainly was not dudes in cabins defending their personal property against the red coats which are to thank.;negative
It is not today's equivalent of gun nuts, it was regular people.;negative
5.;neutral
Paranoid much?;neutral
And you are back to arguing strawmen.;positive
No one ever said gun control would end all violence.;negative
The argument is there will be less violence and all you need to do to curb the amount of violence is a little smart regulation.;negative
Cute.;neutral
Provably false though.;negative
"Watch, ""Hey idiot!";positive
"1+1=2"" Yell that to any random person.";neutral
Strike first and you will remain correct no matter the come back.;neutral
And there aren't many things that hurt worse than a gun so... ?;negative
You have a tendency to support my points brilliantly.;negative
Gun control is punishment?;negative
Wait... I thought you needed those guns to protect from rogue nations... You mean all of this is for a fucking hobby?;negative
What if my hobby is setting shit on fire?;neutral
Should I have to pay just because now and then someone gets burned to death?;negative
What are we talking about here?;neutral
No one is trying to punish you or anyone that likes guns.;negative
You want a gun?;neutral
Fine, cool, knock yourself out.;positive
You can still get a lot of really cool guns so long as you pass a background check, which shouldn't be a problem for you... though this gun debate does have me wondering.;negative
Hell.;negative
Want even more fire power?;neutral
Okay, weird, but whatever I'm for that too.;negative
How about if you are a police officer or have military experience and pass regular paid-for-by-gun-makers psyche exams, you get to buy all the crazy shit you want.;neutral
In exchange lift the ban on suing gun makers if they do end up selling a psycho an arsenal that kills a bunch of random people...;neutral
Now we are letting the market decide!;neutral
And we're holding people responsible!;neutral
And we're addressing the psycho issue!;positive
And you get a super special treat if you're military of law enforcement!;positive
Fair enough?;neutral
As long as we keep the last part, I'd be fine with passing a background check.;positive
But what the new legislation is saying is a lot of my guns now would all of the sudden be illegal.;neutral
I don't want that to happen.;negative
Suing a company because someone misused their product is kinda stupid.;negative
It comes with warning labels, the customer just didn't follow their advice.;negative
They have no legal responsibility.;neutral
Psych tests.;neutral
I'm still debating that one.;neutral
All we really need to do is update our background check system with mental health patients.;neutral
Keeping that list would keep almost all psychos from owning guns.;negative
I don't know what to think on that legislation.;negative
Yeah, but other than that I'm cool.;positive
you live in a civilized country.;neutral
you should not have a lot of guns in the first place.;negative
The zombies aren't coming, so ditch the arsenal.;negative
Like really, a 9 mill.;negative
for personal defense, maybe.;neutral
I may not like it, but I can see it.;positive
Having an M16 in your umbrella stand and an AK on the wall, an RPG in the oven and a minigun on top of the van is goddamned ridiculous.;negative
Ever heard of an undiagnosed psychotic going rampant?;negative
Yeah, that shit never happens, right?;negative
Oh... wait... yeah, it does.;negative
Finally, i know you people are out there, but to those who think that assault rifles are necessary to prevent the oppression of the governemnt.;negative
All i have to say is F-35 JSF.;neutral
go ahead, see what those 5.56 rounds do to that thing while you get eaten by a missile.;negative
Face it.;neutral
you'll never overthrow your government if they go rogue anyway.;neutral
and who do you have to blame?;neutral
Yourselves for your weapon obsessed culture.;negative
Your military is one of the most powerful in the world, if not the most.;positive
Your military is commanded by your government.;neutral
"If you decide to revolt, you're taking a hike up ""just got fucked in the ass by a hellfire"" river.";negative
5.56?;neutral
Who said anything about a 5.56?;neutral
Wimpy little cartridge.;negative
You seem to believe that we would fight them in a straight up war.;negative
Ever hear of guerrilla war?;negative
Pain in the ass for any government.;neutral
If are so helpless, then why have the afghanis defended against the US for so long?;negative
We haven't won yet, and never will.;negative
Greeks tried, Britain tried, Russia, now us.;negative
And they have less men and worse weapons.;negative
Well, if you're just going to use guerilla tactics, why have guns?;negative
bombs can be made from basic household cleaners and they kill just as well with the added shockvalue that bombings have on the governmental state of mind anyway.;negative
No guns necessary.;neutral
Actually, i'd think a backpack is a little less conspicuous than an AK-47.;negative
And you can leave the bag there, detonate the bomb and obliterate nearly all the evidence you were there in the first place.;negative
There you go, 7.62 instead.;negative
you can go all the way up to .70 cal, if you want.;neutral
Naval guns, even, it doesn't change that the most effective way to wage any kind of war on your government, should you choose to do so, will be without firearms.;negative
Well, AK-47s are a great weapon, and fighting a war without a gun is kinda pointless.;negative
Bombs work though, but it's not like we're going to have suicide bombers and terrorists.;negative
Texas had a militia, which was regulated... The point is the purpose of assault rifles.;negative
There is nothing compelling about any of the revolutions mentioned which anyone could reason were an excuse to allow whoever whatever gun they want.;positive
Were the militias armed by the State (our country, lol) of Texas?;negative
Or were the guns the brought mainly the guns they owned before the fighting?;neutral
Did James Bowie bring a box of a hundred muskets and pass them out before the last stand at the Alamo, or did individual soldiers mainly supply their own weapons and equipment beforehand?;negative
It was as combination of both.;neutral
A lot of people did have guns, but hundreds and hundreds were provided by the state in addition to this, and everyone who had a gun was first trained.;negative
The point is A: they weren't a bunch of paranoid hillbillies with trust issues, they were regular people with a firearm maybe used for hunting because they didn't have a grocery store on every corner, and in rare rare instances self-protection because they didn't have police departments in every town.;negative
B: They were a regulated militia trained in lieu of a standing militia which at the time was practically non-existent.;negative
"Anti-gun-regulation (what they really are, not pro gun, no one is ""taking guns away"") proponents make dozens of completely false correlations concerning this time period, along with the many many strawmen they feel a pressing need to argue against no matter the actual debate.";negative
One of the false correlations is the old-time pioneer or the U.S. revolutionary to themselves.;negative
They are neither.;negative
Pioneers did not have guns for the joy of gun collecting and because they were scared of shadows, they had them to hunt and because they lived in areas that were for all purposes often lawless.;negative
Well you're allowed to hunt all you want in the U.S. so long as it's not to the extinction of a species, it's even encouraged where certain species begin to overpopulate.;negative
And you can use firepower that is 100x better than what any pioneer had.;positive
So they have that right plus some.;positive
You are also allowed guns for self-protection, several in fact.;negative
You are allowed firepower that is 100x better than what any pioneer had to protect themselves.;negative
So they still have that right plus some.;positive
"Even though there is 0 threat, 0 none zilch, a complete absence of threat from either a foreign power or a domestic power comparable to anything during the time they dream they are still in, even though we have in place armies and police that they are perfectly free to fucking join if they want to handle all of that for them, we still say ""okay paranoid weirdo, you can have X amount of firepower to satisfy your fantasy""";negative
So they still have that right plus some.;positive
Still, they insist that some right which was granted at the founding of the country is being denied them.;negative
It is the steady and predictable scenario of confusing the addition of rights within a society which would have been unimaginable at that time, decried as some horrid and unjust trampling of freedoms.;negative
It is fucking silly.;negative
Yes, but in the case of fighting back against the government of one such as the United States of America, you cannot state that there is evidence of such a revolution being successful.;negative
The government of the United States is far more powerful than any of the those other governments during that time.;positive
Yes, Libya and Syria were different, if you're referring to the modern day struggles, but they are still war-torn, and it doesn't seem to be getting better.;negative
If we are to even stand a chance against our government, we need more than just guns.;negative
You can't successful fight against tanks, militaristic planes, missiles, and various other weapons with just assault rifles.;negative
So if you're suggesting that all the public needs is assault rifles to combat against a tyrannical United States government, then you might want to recheck what the government's capabilities are.;negative
To be honest, though, I am fine with people having guns, but I see no reason for assault rifle possession among civilians.;neutral
Why do people need something that can release such a large amount of bullets when the gun is already extremely lethal with just one in the barrel?;negative
I have not seen a valid reason as to why any civilian needs one.;negative
If you could please explain that to me, I would be very grateful.;negative
Why do we need a car?;negative
You can mow down so many people with it.;neutral
More people are killed in car accidents in a year than guns.;negative
Knives kill more people than guns each year.;neutral
Why don't we ban those?;negative
If we ever had to go to war (and I hope we never do) I want to have the same weapon the enemy has.;negative
So it's harder to get the upper hand.;negative
The second amendment was designed to keep a people free and a government good.;positive
Now some argue that they never imagined assault rifles (which are already banned anyway).;negative
They didn't, but kinda did at the same time.;neutral
The idea was that the people have the same kind of arms the government has.;neutral
Both sides had muskets and cannons.;positive
We have modern weaponry.;neutral
Disarming a population makes it very easy for the government to get the upper hand.;positive
Now that was about governments.;neutral
Which according to many would crush a revolt.;negative
So lets talk about defense against another.;neutral
Many people have defended themselves and others with these kind of weapons.;neutral
I believe there was a man who defended his home against a mob in LA with an AR-15.;negative
This was a couple of decades ago.;neutral
It is a deterrent against foreign invasion.;neutral
It is a deterrent against criminals.;negative
It is a deterrent against those who want to oppress.;negative
Did you know the US Communist party actually sent a letter to Obama saying banning guns is the right thing to do to advance their agenda?;negative
Communists are pretty radical guys.;neutral
History can attest to that.;neutral
Any gun is lethal.;neutral
Even a little .22 calibre.;neutral
The problem is not the tool, but who uses it.;negative
It's like banning airplanes after 9/11.;negative
Nobody thought of that.;neutral
They wanted to catch the men who did it.;neutral
A man walks in with a weapon and kills 20 children.;negative
They want to ban the gun he used.;neutral
They don't even consider the people or factors that caused this sick man to do what he did.;negative
"It had to be brought up before they said, ""Oh, yeah.";positive
The mental health should be looked at too.;negative
"Or poverty.""";neutral
I think targeting the nerve centers of these is what should happen.;negative
Chicago's and Detroit's poverty should be tackled.;neutral
Doing that would reduce gang violence.;negative
Increasing mental health care and including those records into the background checks would prevent a ton of psychos from handling weapons.;negative
So, I gave you some reasons, why, and what I think should happen.;negative
But you say you have never seen a valid reason.;neutral
The problem is you might have different beliefs to show you what is valid, while I might see it differently.;negative
We both have different views on what is valid.;neutral
So if you think this isn't valid, it might not be to you or many others, but it is valid for me and many others.;negative
Assaultrifles are not necesary.;negative
However only the military or people with special permits are allowed to have access to assualt rifles.;neutral
AR does not stand for assault rifle it stands for ArmaLite which is the comapany that designed it.;negative
An assault rifle has either a fully automatic fire selector switch or a three round burst switch.;negative
No regular civilian will be able to buy one of those.;neutral
What you see the shootings done with are gun that are styled like assault rifles but in are NOT actually assault rifles.;negative
I meant to put that under this.;neutral
What I said was you can, it just costs money to get a permit and full auto weapons are insanely expensive.;negative
Well, civilians can buy them.;negative
But to do that they need a permit which costs money.;neutral
Then the fully-automatic weapons are insanely expensive.;neutral
Your right.;neutral
Cilivians technically can buy them but i know a lot of gun nuts and dont know one that owns a true assault rifle.;negative
Its just plain not worth it.;negative
I mean you can easily spend 10 to 20 thousand on one gun by the time you pay for the gun and all the fees.;negative
No average civilian is gonna be able to buy one of those and a criminal that can afford it will have the money to get it no matter what laws are out there.;negative
Is the argument that assault rifles are necessary to protect against tyranny a lunatic idea;negative
Meaning, just in case the government becomes a tyranny, or if the government is a tyranny, and the people need to protect themselves from it?;negative
Yes, it is.;positive
"We wouldn't be able to defend ourselves from our own or foreign governments with just assault rifles; they have high grade explosives, tanks, unmanned drones, and heavy weapons like grenade launchers and Gatling guns.";negative
Therefore, so we actually can properly defend ourselves in a situation like this, I propose that it be made legal for civilians to purchase and own things like high grade explosives, tanks, unmanned drones, and heavy weapons like grenade launchers and Gatling guns.;negative
"An assault rifle might allow you to kill a few of the tyrants men; all the other weaponry will allow you to take the fight to the tyrant himself.";negative
Yeah, great.;positive
Let's have children go to school with grenades in their backpacks.;neutral
Seems legit, oh look teacher, i brought in my daddy's grenade and if i pull this ou- oh fuck, now it's not just the sick ones, it's the curious ones we've got to worry about.;negative
As i've said before.;neutral
Guns are a symbol of a human desire to KILL efficiently.;neutral
It's, at it's base purpose, not a defensive item.;negative
If you want to defend yourself, get a shield.;negative
Sure, it can be used as a weapon, but at least, you can say with conviction that it was created with the intent to defend.;neutral
You can not defend a gun the same way.;negative
Why do you think that captain america's shield was his most well known tool?;negative
He was a symbol of the DEFENSE of america.;negative
If guns were equal to defense, he's have had a Browning .30 cal instead.;negative
But no, we know him as the guy with a SHIELD.;negative
It is lunacy and a scare tactic to make the NRA rich.;negative
Some people live in delusion.;neutral
You are a perfect example.;positive
If our government ever gets hijacked by someone who wants to be a dictator we need to be able to take our country back that's the main reason we have the second amendment;neutral
We have three branches of government and elections for that.;negative
This is not a valid reason within the realm of reality.;negative
Unless we have a military coup.;neutral
That shoots the 3 branches out of the water.;neutral
Since our military is funded by a different branch than is in charge of what the military does, it would require a military/representative coupe.;negative
Since representatives and our executive depend on votes it would require an over-50%-of-people-who-vote coupe along with a military coupe, and an executive branch coupe, and a representative coupe.;negative
At that point, why not just vote for the shit that has you so upset it's worth a revolution... oh wait what if you lose?;negative
So again, you are back to the only situation in this country where there is a reason for random whoever to have an arsenal, is not self-protection but to impose a minority will on a majority.;negative
---;neutral
"Do you know why the second amendment said ""State"" militia instead of ""federal""?";negative
Southern states wanted to be sure they had the right to form militias to keep any slaves in line who might want to revolt.;neutral
They knew the federal government, influenced by majority not minority slave owners, would not lend a hand should that happen.;negative
May be in their minds, hoping it would happen.;neutral
If one believes in a democratic state and the people's ability to choose right from wrong, they have no need of guns in the hands of every man woman and child,;negative
It is when one lives in unfounded fear of the people's ability to choose right from wrong, or when they wish to impose their beliefs on others, when they feel the need to be so armed.;negative
A coup isn't a vote.;negative
All you need are some rogue generals and the military to follow them.;neutral
Cutting off funding or voting for the right people won't prevent one.;negative
I really don't know how that makes else to you.;negative
Also, the second amendment doesn't mention the states.;negative
It talks about THE State.;neutral
The country.;neutral
It can be applied to individual states, but it was necessary to the security of the country.;neutral
And slavery may have been an influence, but it wasn't a major reason.;negative
Just looking at quotes from the founding fathers would disprove that.;negative
And the right to bear arms is meant for protection, not oppression.;negative
Guns have been satanized by the modern media that it means war, murder, oppression, carnage, and destruction.;negative
They do not cause those.;neutral
Men do.;neutral
We have the right to bear arms to protect against the natural oppressiveness of man.;neutral
What we need to fix is what causes these men to do what they do.;negative
Poverty and mental health are a good place to start.;positive
Why not fix those before we ban guns?;negative
A rogue general and some people and troops who follow that general or generals is not ousting a voted-for representative, and it is also not the least bit possible.;negative
And still, again, you've not described how armed individuals would be any more effective than the military in place.;negative
Why do you refuse to address that?;negative
As in that particular state.;neutral
So individual states.;neutral
Are you disagreeing with the intent of the amendment?;neutral
Or are you misunderstanding it again?;neutral
It was a major reason for southern states though.;negative
An entire book has been written on this hold on... found it http://truth-out.org/news/item/13890-the-second-amendment-was-ratified- to-preserve-slavery;positive
No, a regulated militia is meant for protection and that is all the amendment ever meant, whether that be white slave owners protected from slaves or roving bands of cattle rustlers or whatever.;negative
However, police are far more effective in this area and we see clearly that not limiting the fire power of individuals who are not part of some sort of regulated militia directly correlates to how many innocent people are shot with those guns.;neutral
No, men with guns can cause those things.;neutral
Men without them cannot.;negative
More to the point though, those trained are better at preventing those things and as we see, those who are not are more likely to shoot people on accident or go on killing sprees.;negative
Humans are not naturally oppressive.;negative
It is a rare thing actually.;positive
It just so happens that those who would oppress are the same who also have a higher likelihood to pursue power for power's sake.;neutral
That aside... still.;neutral
If those people don't have guns they are less likely to succeed.;negative
Unless it is a government.;neutral
In which case citizens with guns still don't help.;neutral
The problem is the scenarios which would make unlimited fire power available to all are all ridiculous.;negative
It is out of touch with reality and requires a degree of paranoia and delusion.;negative
Why not fix them all at the same time?;negative
I love that those who are pro guns are all for paying ridiculous amounts of money to arm and train teachers (whether they want it or not) are the same who don't want to pay a penny in taxes to help the mentally ill.;neutral
So, let's compromise.;neutral
One side agrees to not go ape-shit if the people decide certain guns and certain amounts of ammo are not necessary and background checks required for everyone with a gun, and we can put exactly equal effort into fixing the poverty and mental illness which leads to the use of guns in all of these deaths.;negative
btw, that's been what gun control has advocated from the beginning.;negative
But hopefully we've dispelled the usual strawmen pro-gun advocates waste their breath arguing against at this point.;negative
I'm fine with background checks.;positive
I have nothing to hide.;neutral
And funding the fight against poverty is a phenomenal start.;positive
Or some really charismatic guy comes along and executes a hitler style power grab;neutral
You really think that civilians with assault rifles will be able to take back their government, which would hypothetically possess and implement powerful weapons such as tanks, missiles, and heavily-armed soldiers to control the public?;negative
This isn't some fantasized situation from the movies, where the civilians are able to outmaneuver and take back their government.;negative
The United States has one of the strongest militaristic systems in the world.;positive
I'm pretty sure that, in the case of civilians fighting back against the government, the masses would lose.;negative
Using the Second Amendment doesn't even apply anymore.;negative
It was drafted in the 1700s, where technology was limited to basic handguns and rifles, along with the occasional cannon.;negative
Times are different.;neutral
I shouldn't have to explain the numerous advances in militaristic technology.;negative
The ability to kill is significantly higher.;positive
Does this mean that we should just abandon the Second Amendment?;negative
Absolutely not, but there should be restrictions on what civilians should be able to possess, otherwise, if you really want to completely follow the amendment, why not just let everyone have whatever firearm they want?;negative
"I can guarantee that, if everyone possessed a weapon to ""protect themselves"", the mortality rate will rise.";positive
One disagreement that gets out of hand can lead to a standoff.;negative
Do you really want everyone to have to ability to possess high-capacity magazines with their assault rifles?;negative
It's just bound to get out-of-hand, no matter how much regulation is done.;negative
We are only human, and people make mistakes all the time.;negative
Unless there is a way to prevent every single human being from developing even the slightest feeling of anger, I will never back up the argument that assault rifles should be allowed for possession among civilians.;negative
Why do you assume that all humans are ticking time bombs who would kill everyone if only they had a gun.;negative
Trust me if some one wanted to kill gun laws would not stand in their way.if everyone had a gun it would make bad guys think twice before pulling theirs.;negative
And I don't think most of our solders would turn on us.;negative
They are Americans just like us.;neutral
Trust me most solders joined the military to defend there friends and family and fellow citizens NOT the government.;negative
The solders would be on our side and most cops too remember law enforcement and military are some of the most conservative carrier fields around.;negative
200 years ago maybe, but now days, you can kiss you ass good-by, no hillbilly with a gun is going to stop a dam thing vs drones, tanks, bio weapons, nukes ect.;negative
"the argument for needing a gun to protect against tyranny is a joke now days, if our government wanted to take us over they can do it without any effort at all 1 virus and ""Bam"" millions dead.";negative
Gun nuts just want guns for there own selfish reasons now days and use this tyranny argument as an excuse.;negative
Well as the saying goes I would rather die on my feet than live on my knees.;negative
Just make a stand don't ever back down and we'll see how many US solders would shoot at there own citizens just because they were told to.;negative
LOL, here's how it works, okay?;neutral
"this is kind of a ""How to"" guide for ushering in an age of tyranny.";positive
First, fund and reward the people in charge of your military.;negative
Second, after gaining the trust of the military personnel, plant evidence of a growing faction of terrorists in your country, hellbent on the destruction of our way of life.;negative
"Third, convince your constituents that though you ""feel horrible for doing this"" martial law is necessary for the public good.";negative
Tell them that it is their duty as patriots to realize this.;neutral
"Most of your ""gun nuts"" are already on the same side as that tyrannic ruler, by this point.";negative
I mean, what self respecting gun nut isn't a patriot?;negative
And how would it look if a patriot refused the call to patriotism?;negative
We can't have that, now can we.;negative
Gun nuts are now on the side of the government.;neutral
So, as a recap, in three easy steps, you've got a tyrannical government in charge of your country with the support of the patriots who claim to have the second amendment at heart.;negative
And lastly, if step three doesn't go according to plan and the gun nuts don't follow their government, you wanted to know why a soldier would shoot at a civilian?;negative
You're armed.;neutral
"""Gun nuts"" as you call them don't trust Obama we would expect him to lie and know he was talking about us we aren't dumb you know and nether are our solders many of whom are them selves ""gun nuts""";negative
Hitler approved of gun control.;negative
";)";neutral
I never thought I'd say this but I agree with you dictators and dictatorial regimes are notorious for gun control;negative
Thank you.;positive
We can agree on some things.;negative
:);neutral
Australia has very strict gun control laws...;neutral
They're not a dictatorship.;negative
Also, since implementing the laws, gun related crimes are down 60%;negative
^Compelling evidence of working gun control in a democratic environment^;neutral
"It's more about establishing ""need"" which isn't necessary to keep something legal.";neutral
"Only under such a schizophrenic form of tyranny is proving ""need"" for legalization in anyway reasonable.";negative
But welcome to the United States government.;positive
"Held back by ""checks and balances"" and a ""constitution,"" all which are terribly ignored.";negative
I'm fine with background checks.;positive
They can be stricter.;neutral
I have nothing to hide.;neutral
Funding the fight on poverty would be great too.;negative
The law was made to level out the playing feald between the government and the people.;negative
If they ban guns then government leaders will start passing bull shit laws knowing that we can do nothing other than pace around with signs.;negative
At time they had just muskets and yes that is a primative weapon and today we have tanks and many better guns.;negative
takeing away our guns would be like if the founding fathers allowed us to have swords when they had muskets.;negative
I bet they have the kind of socialism you like to.;neutral
I sure as hell ain't moving.;negative
The man who strikes first admits that his ideas have given out.;neutral

Fix the psychos.;neutral
Not the innocent bystander.;neutral
Punishing me is like executing someone for a murder he didn't commit.;negative
Stop punishing me so you can get the false sense of security a gun ban will bring.;negative
A coup isn't a vote.;negative
All you need are some rogue generals and the military to follow them.;neutral
Cutting off funding or voting for the right people won't prevent one.;negative
I really don't know how that makes else to you.;negative
Also, the second amendment doesn't mention the states.;negative
And slavery may have been an influence, but it wasn't a major reason.;negative
And the right to bear arms is meant for protection, not oppression.;negative
Guns have been satanized by the modern media that it means war, murder, oppression, carnage, and destruction.;negative
They do not cause those.;neutral
Men do.;neutral
We have the right to bear arms to protect against the natural oppressiveness of man.;neutral
What we need to fix is what causes these men to do what they do.;negative
Poverty and mental health are a good place to start.;positive
Why not fix those before we ban guns?;negative
Oh my word, has anyone here actually read the second amendment?;neutral
Entirely.;neutral
.;neutral
??;neutral
"""A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.""";positive
This doesn't mean anything to anyone?;negative
"The fact it says a ""well run militia"" ?";neutral
Besides, I do hardly think the Koreans are going to send in paratroopers to invade America now, and all the local hillbilly's of Alabama and Mississippi will need rifles and shotguns to ward them off!;negative
The well regulated militia wasn't intended to be against foriegn powers, it was against a corrupt government.;negative
The military handles the foriegn powers.;neutral
"That being said what happens when the government becomes too corrupt (more than it already is) and has all the big guns and leaves us with none to boot out the corrupt government? """;negative
"--That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.""";negative
-The Decleration of Independence;neutral
The purpose of the second amendment is to ensure us the ability to defend ourselves from our own government not the Koreans.;positive
"""perhaps the most compelling argument for the people to keep and bare arms is to defend them selves from tyranny in government""-Thomas Jefferson";neutral
Ok then, I suppose you just love going around shooting up each other in schools then.;negative
No?;neutral
Then get a move on and get rid of Obama's tyranny.;neutral
Oh there is none??;negative
Odd...........;neutral
When was the last time you had to do anything like that?;neutral
Civil war????;neutral
Tyranny isn't always obvious it can hide quite well in plain sight.;negative
Just wait until the people realize that gun legislation and wire tapping won't make them safer and demand real action then you will se that they don't give a damn about our safety they just want to control us.;negative
I leave you with a question.;positive
If gun control makes us safer why then do the murder rates of Detroit, Chicago, LA, and New York account for over half of the nations over all murder rate?;negative
(not homicide rate);neutral
"Because people who have guns there think "" Oh I know, I'll use it to scare the guy who owes me money!""";negative
Then people are killed.;neutral
That was one of many, many examples.;neutral
Gun legislation sucks, and Obama is doing nothing about it!;negative
"He might say "" Yo senate, maybe you could do this?""";neutral
But that's as far as it would get.;neutral
But this is beside the point.;neutral
The point is, the second amendment is very outdated.;negative
So what should we do?;neutral
Outlaw all guns?;neutral
Britian tried that and crime went UP.;negative
The people who want guns to hurt and kill will get them, even with legislation in place.;negative
While I'm not denying that shooting incidents happen, most of the blaim is on carelessness, how do you check that?;negative
Should we tone down on the assault rifles?;negative
Probably, but that won't stop the people who use them to hurt and kill, because they'll get their hands on them even with legislation.;negative
And the assualt rifle might be needed if we have to defend ourselves against our own military (the corrupt government).;negative
The second amendment will be outdated when we evolve beyond the need for government until the the people must be armed so they can keep the government in check.;negative
Freedom is never out dated.;neutral
It doesn't read The right of the militia to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon it says The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon.;negative
The 2nd amendment is for self defense against criminals, foreign governments and the American government if it becomes oppressive.;negative
"If you don't think a ""good"" government going bad is possible, you probably haven't read much history and live in a fantasy world.";negative
Tbh, Ive never understand why hunting bears was so important to Americans.;negative
Whats so attractives about their arms?;neutral
Maybe they could hang a lovely picture of the countryside or something on their wall instead....;neutral
The Second Amendment is jaded and should be excised from the U.S. Constitution.;negative
"The ""king"" is government even representative governments can become tyrannical and have.";negative
The second amendment is the last check and balance against government power the minute we give it up is the minute we give up freedom altogether.;positive
Although I agree that the second amendment is not outdated, I doubt it's the thing ensuring our freedom.;negative
If government gets too out of control, we (as in regular civilians) won't be able to shut them down with our puny weapons, when their military comes at us with tanks.;negative
Not to mention that if the government gets to be too tyrannical it'd be illegal to have guns against them anyway, so the second amendment would be thrown out, and we'd have to break that rule to combat them.;negative
They can't get rid of the right it's a right not a privilege.;negative
The bill of right dose not give us rights it just lists the rights we are all born with.;negative
the government has no authority to revoke what they did not give us they can erase it from the paper but it will still be our birth right.;positive
So what is a right exactly?;neutral
A freedom that you are born with and that no person or government can ever take away from you.;positive
If that's the case how are people born in other countries not ensured these rights?;neutral
How do convicts and felons lose theirs?;neutral
Convicts and felons loss theirs because sneaky politicians passed a law saying that the government can take away the second amendment rights of con and felons thus in their minds making it no longer a right when in reality cons and felons still have that right its just being legally infringed.;negative
People in other countries are in a similar situation.;neutral
How about the right to life?;neutral
You say a freedom we are born with, yet we are born able to do literally any number of things that are not ensured to us by our rights.;positive
We are born able to kill, we are born able to streak, hell we're born nude, yet that's illegal.;positive
Do you believe our right to be naked is being infringed upon, or our right to kill, steal, cheat, lie in court, etc?;negative
Well I certainly don't believe in anarchy.;negative
Thomas Jefferson himself said order is essential for freedom.;neutral
Besides none of the things you mentioned are even addressed in the bill of rights.;negative
So does the bill of rights list only the thing we are born able to do?;negative
These questions are getting me nowhere.;negative
What I'm saying is rights are way too abstract to even argue points on.;negative
People try to say we're born with them but we are born able to kill, steal, and do whatever we want and can to survive yet all of those things are not legal.;negative
The answer you just gave me, previously, was that when our rights are are not held up or we are persecuted for them that they are infringed on.;negative
Meaning everyone who follows rules are being infringed upon.;neutral
Yet these are acceptable infringements, where as if the government is being oppressive we would be using a right, that they are infringing on to protect ourselves.;negative
What I'm saying is order is essential to freedom but too much government power is detrimental to freedom.;negative
"Government power must remain in the middle the ""Goldie locks zone"" if you prefer.";positive
And how do we the people insure that it dose?;neutral
Well with guns.;neutral
Although private citizens have no access to tanks and what not, this is why it is important to have assault weapons regardless of the second amendment.;negative
Second Amendment gives us the ability to defend our own personal liberty, so if a government becomes tyrannical, then we will be rebellious rather than submissive.;neutral
Also, many soldiers of the government just might not defend an tyrannical government if they believe in liberty, so the numbers may be in our favor anyway.;negative
If we have no right to bare arms, if we are being oppressed, we will get guns regardless of the right.;positive
I'm not arguing that we shouldn't have guns, I'm also not arguing that the second amendment is outdated.;negative
I just don't think the second amendment is the thing assuring us to be able to protect ourselves.;negative
We don't have the right to steal also yet take for instance, we get into a war with the government we will now steal, most likely their tanks to use against them.;negative
Our rights may allow us to legally protect ourselves from other civilians but not against a law making government.;neutral
Rights are only rights because they are ensured by law.;negative
"""perhaps the most compelling argument for the people to keep and bare arms is the defense against tyranny in government""-Thomas Jefferson";neutral
Nope we need assault rifles in case the deer start firing back.;negative
It's not about hunting you dolt it's about freedom.;negative
Hunting was a way to survive in those days they didn't need it to be a right for it to be allowed.;neutral
It's about the defense of freedom from those who would oppress you;neutral
"""The people must not only be armed and disciplined they must be armed with sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a state of independence from those who would seek to abuse them.";negative
"Including their own government""- George Washington.";neutral
"Who exactly are ""those who would oppress you?""";neutral
Do you have specific people/groups in mind, or do you just want to be prepared in case it happens?;negative
Well no one can tell the future but the founders were smart they knew that governments gain power over time even those as restricted as ours.;negative
And they wanted the people to be well enough armed to challenge and deffeat the government on that day.;positive
Our government has already gone way passed its constitutional limits of power and bills like the patriot act and NDAA are worrieing to say the least and now they are trying to ban guns altogether (not all of them thank god but some are) I do t know if it will be this administration that brings down the hammer or a future one but I can't shake the feeling it will happen soon.;negative
I don't want to sound paranoid but look at this new legislation magazine restrictions?!?;negative
Really?;neutral
Do they seriously think criminals and psychos will follow those laws when they clearly have no issue with committing more serious violations like murder?;negative
These laws will be followed only by law abiding citizens we will be the only ones this law effects so why pass a law that anyone with half a brain knows criminals won't follow if your intention is to hinder criminals?;negative
It's become to obvious to ignor we are their targets criminals and psychos and terrorists they love them because they scare us and drive us into voluntary slavery for the empty promise of safety.;negative
I would rather be free and in danger than be a slave and safe.;neutral
Besides, I do hardly think the Koreans are going to send in paratroopers to invade America now,;negative
Many countries have legalized weapons.;negative
In Kazakhstan this question is under debate.;neutral
According to Constitution everyone has the right to protect their lives and property.;positive
In countries where weapons legalized the crime rate is much lower than where gun ownership is strictly prohibited.;negative
Another gun debate.;neutral
I'll state my opion.;negative
Cities with guns allowed have a lesser crime rate.;negative
Cities that ban guns tend to have higher crime rates.;negative
I think guns should be legal but guns used by the army and high caliber rounds shouldn't be legal.;negative
Criminals will always have guns places with gun bans in effect have higher murder and violent crime rates than places where gun wonders hip is less restricted.;negative
So you tell me should we disarm law abiding citizens?;negative
as practise show that criminal use guns against each other but not in massive destroi or kil insent people!;negative
Criminals use guns to intimidate into giveing them what they want.;negative
Even if your alive at the end of the encounter your still the victim.;neutral
Guns prevent that from happening.;neutral
its bad if we are angry than an accident can be possible because in anger we can do everything because those time we can not think what is right if we have dispute to any person there are very possibility hence i do not like to legalization of weapons.;negative
From my point of view, legalization of weapons , for instance, in our country(Kazakhstan), will lead to grave consequences.;negative
Since, if weapons legitimated , our nation will become more cruel and violent.;negative
Because it was prohibited in the past , thus more and more people will take an interest in weapons.;positive
Moreover , they will be obviously sure that they have all rights to do harm to a person who , from their side of view, made something bad for them.;negative
Thereby murder will become more frequent.;neutral
Finally, people will loose their humaneness.;neutral
Summing up all stated above, it can be stated that legalization of weapons should never be permitted in our country.;negative
As we know in the accident with killed 26 students, the weapon was a small caliber and the simple type, you must strictly control the flow and sale of arms;positive
I don't think legalizing weapons is a smart idea.;negative
It reminds me of the Stone Age.;neutral
Also, it can lead to people making homemade bombs.;negative
I think if a persons is in good standing with the law and in good mental health he or she should be able to carry any weapon of choice as long as it is not a weapon of mass destruction.;neutral
Weapons do not hurt or kill.;negative
People with unstable minds do and if all law abiding citizens had weapons they would save a lot of lives.;negative
If all weapons were banned the unstable would still kill with a butter knife or a steak knife maybe a fork how about the the guy who killed his twin brother before going on a killing spree.;negative
I am a police officer and I have seen guns made for under 2.00;neutral
I also seen very very dangerous bombs made for under 1.00 we need law abiding people to be prepared and armed;negative
Hey, if they pass a background check, then let them have whatever they want!;neutral
If they want to kill someone, then they'll find a way to get a gun illegally anyway!;negative
So, you might as well have the good-guys be armed and prepared as well.;negative
Weapons are good for all law abiding people;positive
The more people with weapons the safe the unarmed will be;neutral
Background check are a must but armed citizens help save lives;neutral
Fan studies have long located localized resistances within the cultural productions and practices associated with fandom, looking at http://www.bookwormlab.com/writing-essays how fan fiction, say, might lead to new understandings of gender, and race.;negative
Ummm....have you ever been in a bar, possibly seen a fight or two break our.;neutral
OK, now give the particapints guns, even you can see where this is going and thats just one of many examples of humans acting on basic urges/impulses!;negative
To be human is to be fallable!;neutral
Some weapons are not necessary for a civilian.;negative
A machine gun is not necessary for a civilian.;negative
Perhaps a pistol.;neutral
Regardless, I would not feel safer seeing everyone walking around with a knife or a gun.;negative
The compulsion to use that weapon would be too great.;negative
If you disrespect someone who is carrying that pistol, prepare to have a bullet wound or a stabbing.;negative
Basically by giving all people the choice of carrying around weapons, you give them the power to hurt others.;neutral
A civilized society cannot function when there is senseless violence.;negative
I can see that giving people the right to have a weapon is important for protection.;positive
But certain weapons are not necessary for safety.;negative
One doesn't need a bazooka to be safe, nor a machine gun, nor a chain gun, nor a sniper rifle.;negative
These are superfluous to safety.;negative
Presenting such weapons as protective is misleading.;negative
Additionally, civilians should not be allowed to carry potentially aggressive weaponry in public.;negative
Defensive weaponry would be a better choice, e.g. mace.;negative
How about those of us who enjoy weapons for recreational purposes?;neutral
It's pretty mundane to only have a pistol or rifle.;negative
The Second Amendment wasn't to give permission for recreational gun usage.;negative
It was for protection.;neutral
I only see weapons as justifiable insofar as they are reasonable protection.;negative
It is also about ownership.;neutral
One of the sections mentions a militia, but the other specifies ownership, and I don't believe that it was written in the spirit of limited utility, but as a general right.;negative
Besides, how do you expect to get good enough at shooting if not recreationally?;negative
All forms of weapons are illegal in Japan, and they have an extremely peaceful society.;negative
In Switzerland it is common policy that the citizens are equipped with and trained in firearms, they too are peaceful.;negative
If you look at the big picture, violence in a society doesn't reliably correlate with gun control.;negative
I would argue that it's a combination of cultural values and corruption (like poverty, citizen's rights, etc.).;negative
Jumping from buildings or bridges is a common suicide method in Japan.;neutral
However, my original statement is not only my personal opinion, but also the opinion of one of America's leading criminal psychologists.;neutral
It wasn't an opinion, it was a statement of two facts that do not correlate.;negative
For example: France has some of the world's finest wines, it is also recently very culturally diverse.;positive
Gun laws don't make a peaceful society.;negative
Just recently a shooting spree occurred in the UK, which has stringent gun laws, and the weapon was licensed.;negative
What 'wasn't an option'?;neutral
Robert K. Ressler - a prominent American criminal psychologist - wrote in one of his books that Japan has a very peaceful society, which is caused by their lack of weaponry.;negative
He then contrasted Japan to America, a ruthless and excessively violent nation that terrifies the Japanese people.;negative
Opinion.;neutral
What you wrote were two fact-sentences.;neutral
"An opinion reads like ""I think"" or ""I feel"" etc.";neutral
They can be wrong you know, but going on...;negative
Judging him by what you wrote, he sounds either inept or political.;neutral
There are many countries out there with differing levels of gun control.;negative
Of the stringent countries, some like Brazil still have high amounts of gun violence, others like Japan do not.;negative
Of the laxer countries, Switzerland is very safe but the US has high amounts of gun crime.;negative
In spite of this inconsistency, gun laws are often pushed for out of fear rather than rationality.;negative
People look for things to blame, and aren't satisfied as much with abstract concepts like income disparity, inequality, they would rather blame an object.;negative
My sentiments exactly when you say that paranormal phenomena isn't real.;negative
I always tell you that that is your opinion, but you will not cooperate.;neutral
Do I detect a hint of hypocrisy here?;neutral
As can all those scientists you atheists love to quote.;positive
He wrote that book fifteen years ago.;positive
Perhaps things have changed?;neutral
Not opinion, more like scientific consensus.;negative
I don't quote scientists.;negative
I don't think so, gun violence has existed since the invention of firearms.;neutral
China, South Africa, and Russia have strict laws regarding weapons and they are not peaceful.;negative
All weapons should be banned.;neutral
America already has a serious violence problem pertaining to guns.;negative
I can see that giving people the right to have a weapon is important for protection.;positive
But certain weapons are not necessary for safety.;negative

Absolutely for...it's our right and I love guns.;positive
You can feel the freedom it represents in its touch.;positive
I almost always have one attached to my hip.;positive
That sentiment right there is preciely and exactly the reason US fatal firearm related deaths are usually about an order of magnitude higher than any other country every year, good luck with that.;negative
For those who believe that stricter European gun laws have made a difference, here are just some occurrences involving MULTIPLE shootings:;negative

These are just the multiple shootings, not mentioning the single shootings, so is this an example of how well gun control is working?;negative
At least here, I went through training and an extensive background check to get a license to carry a handgun.;negative
Statistics show that those who go through the same training and check are unlikely to use their weapon in anything other than self defense or defense of others in danger.;negative
I prefer to keep my peace of mind because I know how and when to use it.;positive
Good luck to you.;positive

Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was severely injured with a gunshot to the head.;negative
I present to you a lovely list of shootings.;positive
To know whether gun control does or does not make a difference you need to compare the US's number of shootings and Europe's number of shootings.;negative
You can't just state that it makes no difference based a list of X numbers of reported shootings.;negative
There will always be gun violence.;negative
No matter where you are.;neutral
With or without gun control.;neutral
So,just stating a few cases in Europe does not prove your point.;negative
I don't deny the shootings here, I just get annoyed when it gets stated like it only happens here and Europe is so much better for having the gun control.;negative
As you stated, which was my point, it doesn't matter.;negative
It will happen wherever someone loses it and goes on a shooting spree.;negative
My only point was to the response I got for carrying a gun.;negative
I am legal to carry it, trained in how to use it, have no criminal background, and most all that go through all that are never involved in a violent crime.;negative
There have been very few that were and even a lot of those never involved a gun.;negative
l don't deny the shootings here, I just get annoyed when it gets stated like it only happens here and Europe is so much better for having the gun control.;negative
Those kinds of illogical assumptions annoy me too.;negative
Europe has his own problems to deal with.;neutral
Just because they have gun control does not make them better.;negative
By the way, history shows that their lack of guns was not very helpful toward fighting the ones who did have guns (France and Great Britain, World War I and II were owned);negative
Did I really say that?;neutral
If I did, excuse me, it was not what I meant.;negative
Gun control does matter.;neutral
Gun control has proven to lower the amount of gun violence.;negative
-The people in the US have the right to have a gun.;neutral
Faced with people who have guns, the police must have guns as well.;negative
So, by observing the amount of police who have guns we should be able to estimate the amount of guns the people hold-;neutral
What I am about to say is from personal experience.;positive
It is not real proof of anything.;negative
You can choose not to believe me.;neutral
I have been to France many times to visit my family and I’ve always noticed that a lot of police men did not have guns.;positive
I’ve never ever seen that in the US.;neutral
This is just a tiny remark.;positive
First, if you don’t use a gun to kill someone or something, what do you use it for?;neutral
Second, what you said is not true: in 2006, firearms were used in 68 percent of murders -National Institute of Justice;negative
I could understand the use of guns at war… The rules of war are to eliminate the enemy until he surrenders.;negative
So, guns are the most effective path toward that goal.;positive
What is the point of guns when they are not used for war?;neutral
Why do you have your gun with you at all times?;neutral
I could understand that people have guns to protect themselves from those have guns.;neutral
In neighborhoods, with a lot of drive by shootings, a gun is necessary.;neutral
Stricter gun control will lower the amount of shootings.;negative
Our people do not want gun control, though.;negative

Excuse me.;neutral
I am truly not trying to offend you.;negative
What I said was that those that go through the training and are licensed to carry are less likely to be involved in a gun related murder.;negative
True, guns are for killing, but those of us who choose to be licensed are simply prepared to kill if the threat is presented to us to go to that extreme.;negative
Very few concealed carry licensed individuals have had their licenses revoked due to unnecessary gun violence.;negative
Many of those few have had them revoked due to violence that did not even involve a gun.;negative

criminals did not, and criminals still possess their guns!;negative
While figures over the previous 25 years showed a steady;neutral

These people were 'exterminated' by armies, I don't think if a Jewish citizen owned a gun in the holocaust they could defend themselves.;negative
You may think the claim to be wild, but it's true nonetheless.;positive
It's not true.;negative
They weren't killed because they didn't have guns to defend themselves.;negative
They were killed because they were overpowered by some of the worlds most powerful armies at that time.;negative
Like I said even if they had guns, most of them would have still died.;negative

Criminals are not predators.;neutral
Criminals are parasites.;neutral

When a criminal thinks there's significant a risk that he'll die on his 'job', then he's not going to do his 'job' out of fear.;negative
This is proven.;neutral
Switzerland (or Sweden or something) has mandatory gun ownership for all citizens, and they have some of the lowest crime rates in the entire world.;negative
But then I could argue that there are countries with a lower crime rate and murder rate than Switzerland who do not allow guns.;negative
That doesn't invalidate my point though, LOL.;negative
It just shows that we're both right.;positive
It sounds as if you may be against hunting.;neutral
I disagree with hunting for pure sport, but I fully agree with it if they eat what they kill.;positive
If I've misunderstood, I apologize.;negative
The rest of what you say I agree with wholeheartedly.;neutral
I'm for it because as an individual, I believe that I should have the right to defend myself from people who do not like to play fair (spoiler: criminals don't like to play fair).;negative
As I stated before, the Jewish and French resistance towards the Nazis were actually able to fight back once they got their hands on guns.;positive
When they didn't have guns, the Nazis could round up the jews and gypsies at no harm to them.;negative
Clearly, the banning of all guns does not LEAD to a totalitarian dictatorship... but it surely makes it easier.;negative
If the government has the right then I must have the same right!;positive
All citizens have the right to bear arms because it's in the Bill of Rights...;neutral
I don't see enough benefit from that though...but I gotta obey the law.;negative
If our government ever decides to totally take over, you'll understand it then.;positive
The forefathers had enough insight to know that a government could develop the power to take total control, and they wrote that in so the people would have the means to overthrow such a government once again.;negative
In the U.S. if i were made illegal that wouldn't stop the demand for it, it would instead raise up a new wave of mobsters who would go around terrorizing cities again selling guns at staggering prices.;negative
whilst they would be getting rich, people would end up dead.;negative
That's stupid you have no future premonition.;negative
Perhaps you should take a look at the developed countries that have made gun ownership mostly illegal, look at your own country gun crime statistics and then re evaluate that comment.;neutral
Anywhere that guns are illegal are going to have to pay massive prices to obtain one.;negative
It would still keep gun crime down?;neutral
Take away a mans gun a he will pull a knife.;positive
Since it would be impossible to completely illegalize guns(the massive following against anti gun laws ensures that) the most they would be able to is make people keep it at home.;neutral
So same price, same gun, just keep it at home.;negative
Do you think the people behind shootings are going to obey that law?;neutral

Guns are for self defense and defense against a tyrannical government.;neutral
I live in the United Kingdom where fire arms are for the most part illegal (you can get a licence for hunting guns).;neutral
Although Northern Ireland have slightly different laws so I'll dedicate this argument to England/Wales.;negative
A few facts about the lack of gun crime due to these laws.;negative
A Home Office study published in 2007 reported that gun crime in England & Wales remains a relatively rare event.;positive
Firearms (including air guns) were used in 21,521 recorded crimes.;negative
It said that injury caused during a firearm offence was rare with fewer than 3% resulting in a serious or fatal injury.;negative
In 2005/6 the police in England and Wales reported 50 gun homicides, a rate of 0.1 illegal gun deaths per 100,000 of population.;negative
Only 6.6% of homicides involved the use of a firearm;negative
And just co compare our rates to America where you can own a gun.;negative
By way of international comparison, in 2004 the police in the United States reported 9,326 gun homicides.;negative
The overall homicide rates per 100,000 reported by the United Nations for 1999 were 4.55 for the U.S. and 1.45 in England and Wales.;negative
I suppose it's a situation where you have to be persistent and absolute with the law.;negative
If a lot of people own guns in a country others feel like they have to own a gun for their own protection against people with guns.;neutral
So it ends up in a vicious cycle.;negative
Where as in a country where guns are illegal to own on almost all grounds, no one has a gun so the reason to own one through gun threat is not there.;negative
Those stats are difficult to believe.;neutral
I have British friends who tell me about the problems that are occuring there due to the common man not being able to defend himself in time of need.;neutral
"""Our most conservative estimates show that by adopting shall-issue laws (concealed carry laws), states reduced murders by 8.5%, rape by 5%, aggravated assault by 7%, and robbery by 3%...While support for strict gun-control laws usually has been strongest in large cities, where the crime rates are highest, that's precisely where right-to-carry laws have produced the largest drops in violent crimes.""";negative
~Prof. John R. Lott Jr.;neutral
I'm sorry but 'you have British friends'?;neutral
So my reasonably sourced statistics are hard to believe but you expect someones word of mouth or 'hear say' to be a accurate source of information?;neutral
I have lived in Britain my entire 21 years of life, and no one I know has ever felt they wished they owned a gun to defend themselves or any other weapon for that matter (I've even lived in east London where gun crime is higher than the rest of England).;negative
This gun crime generally stems from 'gangs' who gain influence from U.S gangs (This is from word of mouth of convicted 'gang' criminals not assumption or stereotype).;negative
I'm not saying the U.S.A is to blame at all but there is a lot more 'gang crime' in the U.S than the UK which highly contributes to gun crime.;negative
My point is if gun ownership is about defending yourself against someone else with a gun then isn't complete gun banning a sensible route to take?;negative
If no one has a gun than why would you feel you had to defend against one?;negative
The least you could do is provide some kind of source for your arguments.;neutral
"You indicated a ""home study,"" but you provided no link to the actual numbers.";neutral
"Until such time, I'm relying solely on your ""word of mouth,"" as you put it.";negative
Oh hey, funny how that works out, isn't it?;positive
And no, you're wrong when you say that banning guns will eliminate gun crimes.;negative
Criminals will find ways to get guns, be it through smuggling, the black market, etc..;negative
"You can dispute that all you want, but if you believe in your cited ""home study,"" you will see that there are in fact gun crimes in the UK.";neutral
So interestingly enough, this notion that banning guns eliminates gun crimes is wrong not only through my arguments, but also through your own.;negative
So... murderers, rapists, robbers, and criminals who really want a gun will get a gun.;negative
When my life is threatened by one of these types of people holding a gun to my head, I want to be able to draw on him and defend myself with something other than just my bare hands.;negative
See, but that's relying upon the assumption that banning guns means that no one will have any guns whatsoever.;negative
I disagree.;neutral
That's hoping for some kind of utopian community in which guns do not exist, and murderers have no means to obtain them.;negative
I don't necessarily trust your source, because you didn't give me a link or some location at which I could see the figures you're talking about.;negative
They seem a bit low to me.;negative
"But regardless, those gun crimes you were just talking about from your ""home office study""... if the UK's ban on guns really worked like you say it does, there would be not 21,521 gun-related crimes, but 0 gun-related crimes.";negative
There would be not 50 gun homicides, but 0 gun homicides.;negative
And rather than 6.6% of all homicides making use of a firearm, 0% of homicides would involve firearms.;negative
Now you'll probably wonder, how are gun-related crimes possible when we have a national ban on firearms?;neutral
Simple: the hard criminals who want to get guns and use them for bad purposes will get them, be it through smuggling, trafficking, the black market, or what have you.;negative
The bad guys will get guns and use them for bad things.;negative
"If I ever come across one of those bad guys, I'm going to want to have something with a little more ""umph"" than my bare hands to defend myself with.";negative
No, I don't believe this, my argument supports that by making guns illegal gun crimes will be reduced not completely halted.;neutral
By using the UK statistics (I'm linking you the source and others) in comparison to the U.S.A where, for the most part, guns are easy to obtain it's clear to see that the UK have a greatly reduced gun crime rate.;negative
Instead of demeaning my sources you could have just asked for the links.;negative
You admit they seem low and that's because they are low.;negative
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_Kingdom#Firearms_crime and another link to support this http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6960431.stm;negative
It's not about eliminating it, almost all illegal things are obtainable by some people.;negative
However it obviously significantly reduced the incidents.;neutral
21, 521 that includes air guns (pellet guns) which I imagine, as the rate of injury and death is so low, takes up a large proportion of those figures.;negative
No, I don't wonder.;negative
Just like heroin is illegal, people can still obtain these things.;negative
It's about reducing it.;neutral
I understand that the gun crime rate is lower, and I'm sorry for demeaning your source.;negative
I just appreciate when people provide links to the data they are talking about.;neutral
Personally, I like the idea of being able to defend myself from violent gun-wielding criminals (which will exist in any state, regardless of regulations) with a gun of my own.;negative
If a burglar came into your home, wouldn't you feel safer pulling out a firearm and defending yourself and your family?;negative
Because I sleep safer at night knowing I not only have the ability to defend myself, but the right to defend myself.;negative
"Consider this. """;neutral
'Professors James D. Wright and Peter Rossi surveyed 2,000 felons incarcerated in state prisons across the United States.;negative
"Wright and Rossi reported that 34% of the felons said they personally had been 'scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim'; 69% said that they knew at least one other criminal who had also; 34% said that when thinking about committing a crime they either 'often' or 'regularly' worried that they '[m]ight get shot at by the victim'; and 57% agreed with the statement, 'Most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.'""";negative
(Source: http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcdgeff.html) ) I understand that stricter gun control policies can help reduce the number of gun-related crimes, but you can't deny the fact that the United States's policy helps enable its citizens to defend themselves against armed assailants.;negative
This is the losing side and I just like to bring up contrasting considerations that might lead people astray from how they usually think.;negative
Has anyone figured out yet that we live in the year 2011 and today gun rights may protect you from petty thugs, but will do next to zilch to protect you from the more powerful purveyors of violence and tyranny?;negative

In 2005, 17,002 suicides were committed using a firearm.;negative
The United States far surpasses other countries in terms of gun related violence and death.;negative
The numbers above tend to indicate that fewer gun-related homicides is a direct result of stricter gun control laws.;negative
A particular quote by Benjamin Franklin says, “Anyone who will trade freedom for security deserves neither.”;negative
Although the freedoms enjoyed in this country must be protected and upheld, statistics show that personal security within the United States is greatly hampered by lenient gun control laws;negative

These shooting have nothing to do with guns and everything to do with the unstable individual behind them.;negative
These are people that are getting bullied or feel left out because society has adapted the opinion that being school orientated and less concerned with your peers is weird.;negative
They are labeled misfits because of a opinion that society programmed to think.;negative
Because this starts when were young we must have school faculty either spot socially awkward kids and have programs that develop confidence and people skills or we must inherit the thinking that these kids are not weird and normal individuals with different interests.;negative

They may use knifes,hammers, or other weapons to kill instead.;negative
So fix the internal issue not that external;neutral
I at a loss for words, I am baffled on how anyone can think guns have nothing to do with violence, if you want a clear example on how you are wrong all you have to do is look at the rest of the world and counties that have very strict or out right bans on guns and compare them with the USA, any clear headed logical mind can plainly see that guns & violence go together like peanut butter and jelly.;negative
Stricter gun crimes mean only OUTLAWS can get guns.;negative

Every year children die in the US due to firearms.;negative
If you had a child who was killed by a accidental shot, you would be most upset.;negative
If we put tougher laws on them, or even ban them, we should drop the rate of death considerably.;negative
Children also get killed by household cleaners should we ban those too?;negative
Instead taking guns away parents should put their guns in a safe place that is away from their children.;neutral
The reason for children getting killed by guns is that the parents do not take the necessary measures to ensure that their children are safe.;negative
Guns are dangerous.;neutral
In the wrong hands, they can cause unnecessary deaths.;negative
We should ban guns, because, adults or even kids could get their hands on them, and can cause unneccessary deaths;negative

Guns are the top killer weapon in USA.;positive
Although people might say that it is for self-defence, it is used as a weapon and it is a non-living thing that means a living thing, a person, is the cause of the deaths or injuries from the gun.;negative
In other countries, people can smuggle or illegally buy them to cause disturbance or deaths.;negative
In the hands of a crazy or brainless person, the item can now be called very dangerous.;negative
To be exact, its not the gun but the person who is bad or insane.;negative

If guns should be banned cars should be banned too.;negative
If guns kill people, the same can be said for cars.;neutral
They are both useful and dangerous.;neutral
They both kill a lot of people every year.;neutral
My point is that Guns and Cars are both useful and that there is no good reason to ban them.;negative
Cars have many uses that don't involve killing things.;neutral
Guns have few uses that don't involve killing things.;neutral
What is your point?;neutral
If I want to have a firearm in my house, I can.;negative
It doesn't matter how useful you think it is.;neutral
Sure it does.;negative
To see why, imagine your neighbour had grenades, a tank, chemical weapons, or a nuclear bomb in their house.;negative
Would you sleep soundly at night?;negative
Might you wonder what kind of use he had in mind for those weapons?;neutral
One of the roles of government is to protect people from each other.;positive
If Joe Sixpack wants to buy a machine gun so he can mow down a herd of deer, that's fine...in a disturbing sort of way.;positive
However, the more destructive a weapon becomes, the more likely it'll be used intentionally on another person for reasons other than self-defense.;neutral
That's why the public has an interest in regulating, if not outright banning guns.;negative
None of those are guns!;negative
If someone breaks into your house and he/she has a gun would you still be for banning guns?;negative
Or would you blow the mother f*er's head of?;neutral
They're weapons.;neutral
You can't discuss banning guns without banning other deadly weapons in general.;negative
Seeing as how no one has ever broken into my house with a gun, or anyone I know of, I'm not too concerned with that scenario.;negative
I'd be much more concerned about accidentally shooting myself or someone else.;neutral
Well just because you can't handle a gun does not mean that more responsible people can't either.;negative
"""imagine your neighbor had grenades, a tank, chemical weapons, or a nuclear bomb in their house.";negative
"Would you sleep soundly at night? """;negative
No, but if they legally owned a handgun or a rifle I would.;neutral
But chances are I wouldn't know.;negative
Protection.;neutral
Thats why it's legal for me to own a weapon in my house, thats why the founding fathers thought it necessary.;negative
See grenades aren't legal to own in my house.;negative
Because they are not a valid source of protection for if a stranger came into my house at night to steal my things and threaten my life.;negative
Are you kidding me!?;neutral
That's why I'm allowed to own a firearm!;negative
If somebody breaks into my house at night and comes at me with a knife I can take out my Smith and Wesson 500 magnum revolver and peel some led.;negative
If guns are banned, the only people that will be affected will be the people that buy guns for protection from criminals, who get their guns illegally anyway.;negative
"""guns dont kill, ppl do""";neutral
do you know that canada has more armed citizens and less murders.;negative
and that is with pot being legal.;neutral
not only that but the us consitution specifically says that guns are allowed and that is so that we cannot be oppressed by the government.;negative

Whether guns were banned or not, people will still find a way to illegally obtain them--especially criminals.;negative
Those who abide by the law would be left defenseless if and when their life is threatened.;negative

No because then people will be completely defenseless against the police & criminals.;neutral
& weak people won't be able to defend themselfs against stronger people.;negative
So by your logic, everyone in Canada and Europe must have been murdered by criminals and crooked police, since they have such low rates of gun ownership?;negative
His logic is that with no firearms owned by the people of a country, it allows things like government, police and criminals to seize power, control its people and turn into a totalitarian state.;negative
As I recall such a thing has happened in Europe, Russia and China just in the past century.;negative
What happens when the police have power over its people...things like Waco and Ruby Ridge happen, or more recently people in the middle of the Katrina disaster were disarmed by the police state and left to rot in the middle of a destroyed city full of criminals.;negative
The job of the government is to serve its people, not take control of people as if they are subjects.;negative
The second amendment is the least understood out of everything in the constitution, and little do you seem to know, that if you throw this one out, you might as well throw them all out.;negative

So let me get this straight:;neutral
1.;neutral
You state that without guns, we'll get killed/imprisioned/brutalized/etc.;negative
2.;neutral
I prove you wrong by stating the FACT that other countries have little gun ownership but are not being killed/imprisioned/brutalized/etc.;negative

You're only counterargument is an ad hominem attack.;negative
"""Guns should not be banned.";negative
"the police will have even more power over us than they do now.""";neutral
I don't see your point.;negative
Are you implying that when you're unhappy with the police, you go out and start shooting them, or at least intimidate them with threat of violence?;negative
In what world is that valid logic for owning a gun?;negative
We're a nation of laws.;neutral
When police abuse their authority, they're dealt with by the law.;negative
Whenever I hear about a dirty cop being exposed, it's due to a reporter or a pedestrian with a camcorder, not some guy with a shotgun.;negative
even guns are banned people are still going to find a way to get guns.;negative
all we are doing is creating another Scarface and it states under the second amendment that we shall bear arms;negative
banning guns wouldn't be the smartest thing to do.;negative
"We would just be turning them into ""forbidden fruit"" and by doing so, we will create more chaos in the world.";negative
If you ban guns people will not be able to defend themselves from a burglar.;neutral
What if the criminals get guns and honest folks do not have them?;neutral
Well, no one would be safe,;negative
So should we legalize murder then?;neutral
After all, people are going to figure out how to kill other people even if we illegalize murder.;negative
umm yes;neutral
you have the right to BEAR arms.;neutral
So mount them on your wall.;negative
Don't go around carrying a gun,....;neutral
smh idiot...;neutral
I don't really agree with either side.;negative
I don't think guns are good or bad.;negative
I think they're just... guns.;neutral
"To say they're bad, implies they're useless; to say they're good, implies they're beneficial.";negative
I'm kind of in the center on this topic.;positive
"I don't like that ordinary citizens can buy guns for ""protection.""";negative
I don't give a sh*t how much they think it'll save them against a burglar or rapist or whatever.;negative
Because there's still the increased risk (which outweighs the protection factor) of it being used for the wrong reasons, or of kids getting their hands on it, or of just standard reckless usage.;negative
Why not every get off their ass and use the money for karate lessons instead?;negative
Just because at some point someone might hold a gun on you, doesn't mean you need to lower yourself to their level and do the same.;negative
However, I am for police and the military having guns, at the very least.;neutral
At least they're more properly trained for using them and in certain situations.;negative
So, with that said, I'd rather guns were just not available to the general public, period.;negative
If they want better protection, there are MANY other options.;negative
How about stun guns?;neutral
Electrocute those balls!;positive
Hehe.;neutral
guns are used for protecting first,if you want kill sb,other tools can do it,not only guns,so it is not the guns fault,why guns should be banned?;negative
there are many people out there where a gun has saved their life or another member of their family.;neutral
it is also too bad that some gun owners became gun owners after something tragic has happened to them.;negative
guns don't kill people....;neutral
people kill people so guns shouldnt be banned people can kill with knifes and all sorts of things so guns shouldn't be banned cause many people enjoy shooting them and if someone had an intention to kill someone they would kill them without a gun if they wanted to so no guns should not be banned and guns are used to hunt to so that's about it;negative
Guns don't kill people.;neutral
People kill people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;neutral
Think aboit this what would you do if someone broke in to your house and the power and cell phone recption was down and u had no way to call the cops and handguns where band what would you do if that happens?;negative
Guns help protect people when a robber comes into there home they can shoot him maybe because they are defending there home;neutral
Guns are good.;positive
But this is an old debate.;positive
I don't see how it got revived.;negative
you simply cannot take away our right to own guns what happens if a serial rapist/murderer breaks into your house with an illegal gun?;negative
"even if you heard him break in and called the cops it still takes a while for them to respond so while the cops are taking their sweet ass time to get here the bad guy has all the time he needs to kill you rape your wife and daughter then kill of anyone else and steal whatever he wants then he is free to go before the cops even get there so would you rather the cops show up to find a house full of deap people or a house full of safe people because you were able to shoot the bad guy and disarm him .....if obama allows this gun ban to happen i think someone should go to the white house and beat him half to death with a stick then write a note in his blood that says ""go ahead ban wood....."" what if i killed someone with a furbie .....";negative
what exactly is the logical thing to do ban furbies?;neutral
yes some poor bastard was bludgeoned to death with a furbie....;negative

Disarmed People = Are Dominated People;neutral
Simple as that so do we really want to ban guns?;negative
no way.;neutral
You can use guns for self defense.;neutral
Just use it in a coorect way so that you won't kill people.;negative
That's why the public has an interest in regulating, if not outright banning guns.;negative
I'd be much more concerned about accidentally shooting myself or someone else.;neutral
Might you wonder what kind of use he had in mind for those weapons?;neutral
One of the roles of government is to protect people from each other.;positive

Nope.;neutral
Recently, in our country guns are banned.;negative
What happened?;neutral
More crime and more people are getting angry because of it.;negative
Besides, guns are not only used for crimes and the like, but also for self defense.;negative
I think it is somehow useful.;neutral
Gun ban is not really a solution to the problem of a country, but I think it is the wrong implementation of some laws, thats why people do crimes over and over again.;negative
No, banning all guns would be overkill.;neutral
I do however think that we should consider places restrictions on the sale of assault rifles.;negative
Let's first view it from a passive view.;neutral
Almost everybody is in favor of resolving issues with, well, non-violence.;neutral
This requires application of wisdom and intelligence.;positive
However, the man on the receiving end HAS to be intelligent enough to accept and understand your views.;neutral
Saying this, it is already clear that not everybody can understand such views.;negative
Some fools try to do things forcibly.;negative
THAT is where violence originated, to try to make fools understand the point.;negative
Here, some may say that violence is prone to be misused.;neutral
Well, the so-called wisdom has been misused more badly, quite often swaying people to the wrong side with their so-called sensible talk.;negative
To make this statement more clear, wisdom is not a fixed code, but what is right at a given time.;neutral
The bad people try to lull people to their side by making them see what is wrong, right.;negative
Thus, all said and done, guns are a means of enforcing law and order and, well, to put it in the language of this argument, put some sense into the heads of the fools.;negative
Since fools cannot understand the language of wisdom, they have to understand the language of guns.;negative
no way whats protects our borders,guns what protect the government,guns what protect the president, guns;negative
no this is america one of the things that makes us the great nation we are is the US Constitution and all of the rights it and its amendments grant its citizens and if guns were banned there would be another civil war;neutral
They can't take away guns in itself, but if they stop the production of gun ammo, then the guns would be useless once stock ran out.;negative
Hello from England.;neutral
No.;neutral
Don't use Piers Morgan as UK's spokesperson.;negative

I just need to know for a project at School;negative
Getting rid of Assault riffles would help but getting rid of hand guns would not.;negative
How do you define assault rifles?;negative
What constitutes one and makes them more dangerousness then say a semi automatic hunting rifle.;neutral
so technically you're in favor of no, but the question is too open ended.;neutral
Hand guns are used in 89% of gun murder in this country and assault rifles are used in 3%, but getting rid of assault rifles would be helpful while getting rid of hand guns wouldn't.;negative
Oh...sure...that makes total sense.;negative
Why haven't you posted the % of handguns used in mass shooting vs. % of assault rifles used in mass shootings;negative
it's about 89% to 3%.;negative
They make handguns in semi-auto now, ya know...;neutral
you making up these stats or actually got a source?;neutral
I think it would help a little bit.;neutral

We have already banned drugs and they are a bigger problem than ever.;negative
Criminals will always have guns so should we.;positive
I'm talking about smuggling guns across the border like they already do with drugs and selling them on the black market like they already do with drugs.;neutral
Gun control won't get rid of guns it will just make them untaxable (I hate taxing guns but still) un traceable, and make them a much bigger problem.;negative

Most gun owners are hunters or they participate in shooting sports.;negative
In some cases, the gun is how some family's survive.;neutral
Some people can't afford to buy food they they hunt deer and other game.;negative
I'm currently a gun owner and i use them for shooting sports, like target shooting.;negative
Regulation or restriction on the sale should be imposed, a ban isn't going to work anyway, as much as drugs are banned, they are still circulating the streets.;negative
Gun sale should be controlled and only those who gone through testing and training should be allowed guns.;negative
I love those who don't read argument and just pass the post with a vote down.;positive

However, if you mean that the government should repeal the 2nd amendment to the constitution of the U.S., hell yes!;neutral
This specific amendment has long outlived its use.;negative
"""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""";positive
States now have an all volunteer full time armed forces, known as the national guard.;neutral
Nowhere in the 2nd amendment does it state that the right to bear arm is to protect against a tyrannical U.S. government, as some gun rights advocates claim.;negative
In fact, this is considered treasonous.;negative
The reason many are willing to keep their guns till death (i.e. ...from my dead cold hands) is due to fear.;negative
For most of these people, guns have been the security blanket from childhood on against unsubstantiated threats that are primarily produced and maintained by the media.;negative
Many minority groups have been used to justify such unsubstantiated threats, but none like the blacks.;negative
Blacks remain the ongoing bogymen that keep many gun lovers awake at night and scared during the day.;negative
It is illogical to continue to allow guns to proliferate to an extent that our existence is threatened just so that we can appease a few who have failed to outgrow their childhood fears.;negative
Yes.;neutral
Government should ban the sale of guns.;negative
People they don't know when to use guns and to who?;neutral
They use it where ever they are just to be seeing a giants/bosses.;neutral
If you check now from the South of America there are shooting each and every week because of legalizing guns for safety.;negative
People die like birds in a painful way.;negative
Young pupils carry guns at school, colleges and university to scary the opponent which is a bad reputation in a society.;negative
Government and it's cabinet should take this problem further before it becomes a horrible united states of Guns not united states of America.;negative
Yes!;neutral
21% of the USA have guns, and a part the 21% are going to belong to gangs.;negative
Selling guns legally makes it much easier for gangs to acquire them.;negative
However, there are some important uses for guns.;neutral
Self Defense(especially in big cites, such as Washington DC and New York) and hunting.;positive
So I believe people should only be able to acquire one with a license.;positive
Absolutely, simply because guns kill innocent people.;negative
Do you see people walking around with guns in places like Blackpool no.;neutral
Where as in places like Houston and Austin people just walk around with guns.;negative
I totally agree with the fact that guns do not cause the damage it's the person holding it which causes the damage.But still just being able to walk around public places in America with a gun increases the risk of someone being seriously injured or even killed.;negative
Which is the main reason why I think people should not be aloud to purchase guns In america or any other place in the world simply because of that risk.;negative
Yes because people buy guns for what reason?;neutral
To kill.;neutral
if it is against the law in kill, it should be against the law to own guns, since they are made to kill.;negative
"people sometimes argue against me with ""hands also can kill"".";neutral
but hands are not made to kill.;negative
they are made to hold things, open things, etc.;neutral
Unless your are a certified hunter or law enforcement , carrying a gun around shouldn't be legal.;negative
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the exact reason why the majority of all countries worldwide despise America.;negative
The idiocy in allowing pretty much ANYONE to have ownership of a gun.;negative
Like, wow!;positive
How stupid can you get?!;negative
"The most common perception American see the gun as is a ""tool to protect with"", but guess what?!?";neutral
"You would not need this ""protection"" if they were illegal in the first place!";neutral
The only good use that America's guns would ever do is in the highly unlikely event of a zombie apocalypse.;negative
Which, like I just said, is highly unlikely.;negative
Guns are dangerous and banning them would be wonderful.;positive
Get rid of the guns!;neutral
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
Given recent shootings, such as the one in Connecticut, that wouldn't have happened had the usage of guns been banned in a civilian population.;negative
Also, guns cause war, and we want to stop war.;negative
Why not just ban guns from American civilian populations?;negative
Guns don't cause war.;negative
That's like saying a hammer built a house.;neutral
The people behind the tools cause the war, or build the house.;negative
A gun is a tool.;neutral
Every tool can be misused be it a hammer, chainsaw, or gun.;negative
It's the psychopaths that misuse the tool.;negative
Yes, guns don't cause wars.;neutral
But they certainly make wars more likely and deadly.;positive
A hammer's entire justification for existence is to hit a nail on the head.;positive
In comparison, a gun's existence is to kill, namely to kill people.;negative
So, stop the BS that guns don't kill.;negative
Guns kill, and they kill fast and extremely efficiently!;positive
Oh bullocks.;neutral
Guns do not kill, people kill .;negative
Are you saying guns don't kill people as in feathers don't kill people, or guns don't kill people as in guns don't aim and pull their own triggers?;negative
Yes I am.;negative
Guns are inanimate objects.;neutral
They can do nothing without human action.;neutral
You're pretty darn good with stating the obvious.;neutral
You have no argument there.;neutral
Thank you.;positive
:);neutral
I couldn't have said it better myself.;negative
That's exactly why.;neutral
Thank you.;positive
See, we CAN agree on something.;positive
:D;neutral
Yeah, we can.;positive
Just don't let it get into your head that we can all the time!;negative
Haha!;neutral
";)";neutral
Tee hee!;positive
:D;neutral
But murder is banned and that didn't stop the killer.;negative
The problem with gun control is you can't legislate crime out of existence.;negative
Guns take crimes of passion and cause murders.;neutral
Without a gun is much harder too snap and kill a school full of kids with a knife.;negative
A guy in China almost did it.;neutral
He severely injured almost 30 people in a school.;neutral
Many were close to death.;neutral
Yes but if he had a gun many more would of died.;neutral
You just made the best anti gun argument possible against yourself.;positive
Guy in China stabs people no one dies.;neutral
Guy with gun in CT, 20 die.;negative
Get the difference?;neutral
Ah, but here is the kicker.;neutral
IT WAS STILL ILLEGAL TO CARRY THAT KNIFE INTO THAT SCHOOL!;negative
Yet he did it anyway.;neutral
It doesn't matter if the knife or gun is illegal, people are still going to do it.;negative
I would rather have someone defend themselves against that.;negative
Well.;neutral
It was against school rules lol.;neutral
Hardly illegal to own a knife.;negative
Good try though.;neutral
Eh, it was worth a shot.;positive
Haha!;neutral
Blablabla, needs this to get over limit.;negative
Lalala.;neutral
A lot of passionate crimes, serial killers, were done without a gun in most cases.;positive
Mass killing is caused by gun, but mass killings are not done with passion but with despair.;negative
Passion takes enjoyment and planning.;positive
most murderers feel that their killings are just and fair and that they are dealing justice.;positive
well in some cases yes in some cases no but in any case the killer is willing to break one law to accomplish there goal whether ther motivation is psycotic rage or delugion.;neutral
laws dont stop criminals and psycopathes.;negative
And I agree with some of those murderers.;positive
";)";neutral
First of all guns will still be provided to armies and such, you know the people who actually are involved in war?;negative
Civilians having guns has nothing to do with war.;negative
And yes it would have.;neutral
Criminals don't obey laws.;negative
they would have killed innocent people anyways.;neutral
Banning the usage of guns would have done nothing to prevent that.;negative
No, idiots in charge of countries and the people cause war.;negative
It would have happened even if guns were banned, he would have gotten hold of another gun or a knife then gone in stabbing.;negative
yes picos ther is alot of crim out ther and if you have a gun you can defend your self or even beter you can help the pipol in danger.;negative
pleas check out me deabat(if you se a opertunatey too mack money should take it);negative
AND im 12;neutral
Unless you want to change the Constitution, you should be able to have guns.;negative
It is the finger that pulls the trigger that kills, not the gun.;negative
No it's the gun.;negative
Try killing someone with a finger.;neutral
Is fucking impossible.;neutral
In 2011, hammers murdered more people than AR-15's in the USA.;negative
Source: FBI;neutral
And it's the finger THAT PULLS the trigger.;negative
Well you defeated your own argument.;negative
AR-15s are prohibited much more widely than handguns.;neutral
I'd say that's gun laws working :);neutral
Unfortunately we need hammers to hammer things so we can't ban them.;negative
Luckily guns have no other purpose than too kill people so we can do away with them n;negative
You could hammer a nail with most handguns.;neutral
So they're at least as useful as hammers.;neutral
And what, you've never been hunting before?;negative
What, you've never gone shooting before?;negative
What, you've never been in a self-defense situation before?;negative
Guns have plenty of uses outside homicide.;neutral
That's your argument.;neutral
We hammer nails with guns?;neutral
Really?;neutral
I'm fine with hunting rifles like the laws in Canada.;positive
You don't hunt with handguns.;negative
Shooting is stupid.;negative
It's not a good excuse for 10,000 dead people a year.;negative
Owning a gun makes you 4.2 times more likely to be shot by a gun.;negative
It's not good for self defence.;negative
Only 0.5% of gun owners say they have scared off someone with a gun (and what % of that is pure delusion).;negative
While 67% of crime is committed with a gun.;neutral
Good trade?;neutral
Feel safer?;neutral
Guns put holes in things you want dead.;negative
That's it.;neutral
It was supposed to be funny.;negative
Lighten up a bit, buddy.;neutral
I know plenty of people who hunt with handguns, or require a sidearm when hunting more aggressive animals.;negative
Sport shooting kills 10000 a year?;negative
Where did you get the 4.2 times statistic?;negative
I'm wondering if it includes self-inflicted injury, in which case that's about as relevant as saying owning a toaster makes you 4.2 times more likely to be burnt by your toaster.;negative
As for a gun not being good in self-defense, what would you use in self-defense if confronted with criminal gunmen who were trying to harm you?;negative
Just curious.;positive
I also don't think you can really reference criminal activity, here.;negative
They're breaking the law in the first place.;neutral
Why would another law suddenly stop them cold?;negative
If criminals want guns they'll get guns.;neutral
Heroin is illegal, do criminals not use, traffic in, and deal heroin because it's illegal?;negative
of course not.;neutral
So why do you think a ban on guns would have a significant impact on criminal gun use?;negative
They're already, by definition, law breakers.;negative
And yes, guns can be used to put holes in things you want dead.;negative
And sometimes I want or could potentially want someone or something dead, so guns are very handy for that.;negative
Well then they don't get to murder deers with glocks anymore.;negative
No sport shooting doesn't kill 10,000.;negative
You used it as an excuse for why guns should be legal.;negative
Just pointing out how shitty a trade off that is.;negative
(This is how many gun murders btw);neutral
"Even if the 4.2 does include self inflicted ""injury"" (death) How many people die from toasters each year.";negative
Because the number of people who die from guns in the U.S. annually is over six figures if you include self inflicted harm.;negative
I would use nothing if someone was trying to rob me.;negative
First of all, it rarely, if ever happens to people in their lives.;negative
You make it sound like you're scaring them off left and right.;negative
Again only 0.5% have reported using their gun to scare someone off.;negative
And the reason you're 4.2 times more likely to be shot is because a criminal with a gun will shoot some dumb John Wayne who thinks he's going to save the day.;negative
Give then your $40 keep your life and help create a society that doesn't have people who need to rob you instead of arming everyone like its Mad Max;positive
Of course I can.;neutral
You can't just say your stats don't count lol.;negative
Legal guns BECOME illegal guns when they're stolen.;negative
You all use this illegal guns thing but its a lot fucking harder to get an illegal gun then a legal one.;negative
They will never go completely away.;negative
But if you look at NYC (safest city and strictest gun laws) or any other industrialized country with its head on straight.;neutral
You'll see your argument doesn't have any weight.;negative
Deer aren't aggressive animals likely to charge you if you don't kill them in the first shot.;negative
Some animals, like boar, are, and if you're getting charged by a wild boar you might appreciate having a glock at your side and not some single-shot rifle with a scope.;negative
Sport shooting was just one of the reasons guns should be legal.;negative
Do you not know where you got the statistic from?;negative
And it's not a matter of how many people die from toasters each year, it's a matter of the statistic being completely unimpressive and almost completely irreverent to the discussion we're having if it does include self inflicted injury or death.;negative
Obviously owning something (anything) is a great way to increase your chances of hurting yourself with it.;positive
"Like, ""people who own weight sets are 4.2 times more likely to drop a weight on their foot than people who don't own weights.""";negative
Well duh.;neutral
I've been robbed (like, me, my person, not my apartment or car) twice in the past 3 years.;negative
Gave up my stuff voluntarily once and got shit shit kicked out of me and had it taken the other time.;negative
My car and my residence have both been broken into on other occasions.;negative
I have been pick-pocketed.;neutral
Perhaps these things are rare occurrences if you live in suburbia, but some of us live inner-city, where this shit is a daily reality.;neutral
We don't actually know if the 4.2 statistic exists because of the John Wayne-complex because you haven't cited it yet so I don't know what info the statistic draws on.;negative
"How does giving criminals your money when they mug you ""help create a society that doesn't have people who need to rob you instead of arming everyone like its Mad Max""?";neutral
I can say they're pointless stats to reference when your proposed solution to stop the law-breaking activity you are referencing is just to throw another law on top.;negative
"Legal guns become illegal when stolen (""hot,"" actually,) but some guns are illegal from the get go, shipped here from out of country or illegally procured or produced here.";negative
And I don't know about it being more difficult.;negative
"Legal guns are usually more expensive, and there's a bunch of background check shit and paperwork and sometimes a waiting period when you go to buy a legal gun; I just need to make a phone call and have a few hundred bucks and I can get an illegal gun.";negative
Also according to some info I pulled from the US Department of Justice, only about 8% of violent crime is committed with a gun... where are you getting the 67% figure?;negative
My stat was from 2008 but even still I would have a hard time believing it increased 59% in 5 years.;negative
So 10,000 dead people so you can shoot Boar.;negative
Got it;neutral
4.2 times more likely to be shot was a statistic from the FBI.;negative
And it's completely relative to the argument.;positive
You say owning a gun makes you safer, from crime and what not.;negative
But it doesn't, it makes you 4.2 times more likely to be harmed.;negative
So you can't use defense as an argument.;negative
I spend half my year in NYC.;neutral
Hardly Suburbia.;negative
Safe city though.;neutral
Might have to do with the strict gun laws.;neutral
That's not the way we create a society where people don't need to rob you.;negative
Simply pointing out our efforts maybe better served creating that world instead of shooting anyone who plans to commit crime.;neutral
And you're right.;positive
SOME guns are shipped here from out of country.;negative
I guess we shouldn't improve anything then lol.;negative
I'm going to lift something from another comedian friend of my Sam Rudykoff.;positive
Guns crimes are the only crime that people think they can solve with more of the problem.;negative
When kids get molested nobody says we should get more pedophiles.;negative
That's exactly the line of thinking you're subscribing too.;negative
And the statistic about 67% of crime being committed from a gun was from justfacts.com A website someone on your side tried to use against me early.;negative
The difference in our stats is that you tried to sneak violent crime in as the same thing.;negative
Clever, but I noticed.;positive
really that would only leave murder and pistol whipping.;negative
Most violent crime is abuse or assault.;negative
67% of crime includes robbery's and such.;negative
You know, the thing that happened to you.;neutral
What do you have against listing all of the things I mentioned?;neutral
Why do you only list one... is is because it seems like a less significant trade-off if you do it that way?;negative
"Also, you keep throwing this 10,000 number around, but did you know that .5% statistic you used earlier (a low estimate, btw; some are as high as 3.5%) amounts to 162,000 incidents per year that someone uses a gun to prevent someone from being killed?";negative
"So ban guns and you might save 10,000; you also kill 162,000.";negative
Did you read my argument at all?;neutral
"Until you link me the statistic we can't know if a gun makes you safer from crime or not; perhaps owning a gun just makes you 4.2 times more likely to shoot yourself in the foot, which says nothing at all about a firearms impact on crime.";negative
I wasn't using self-defense as an argument, I was asking if your argument included self-inflicted injury.;negative
And you flat-out refuse to show me the statistic, for some odd reason.;negative
"It doesn't really matter if it's not suburbia; the point is it's safe, and it's not like that everywhere.";negative
"If you're safe and protected you probably don't feel the need for self-defense; if violence is a real problem around you on a daily basis, you might rethink that position.";negative
And I refuse to believe that even national strict gun laws will end violent crime.;negative
"First of all I would like to clarify that we were talking about shooting someone who was in the act of committing a crime against you, not ""shooting anyone who plans to commit crime.""";negative
Secondly, if that's not the way to create a better society, why did you say it was?;negative
"You offered no way to ""create that world"" other than handing the criminal your wallet.";negative
"Excuse me, nowhere in my posts have I made the argument ""we need to solve gun crime/violence with more guns,"" nor is that an argument you will ever hear me make.";negative
So putting words in my mouth like that is a blind and baseless assumption (at best) and a deliberate straw man (at worst).;negative
"I didn't ""try to sneak"" anything; I simply thought a statistic talking about how often guns are used as tools of visual intimidation wouldn't do much for your position against violent gun use and crime, so I figured your statistic probably addressed violent crime.";negative
I see I was wrong.;negative
"However, my statistic: ""Based on survey data from the U.S. Department of Justice, roughly 5,340,000 violent crimes were committed in the United States during 2008.";neutral
These include simple/aggravated assaults, robberies, sexual assaults, rapes, and murders.;negative
[13] [14] [15] Of these, about 436,000 or 8% were committed by offenders visibly armed with a gun.;negative
"[16]""";neutral
"So my statistic does include ""robbery's and such.""";neutral
Y'know, the thing that happened to me.;negative
Sorry Boars and Angry Deers;neutral
It's 0.5% of gun owners (which should have been obvious.;negative
Not everyone.;neutral
Also it's pretty silly to say even those people would all be MURDERED lol.;negative
You're 4.5 times more likely to be shot.;negative
4.2 times more likely to be killed by one.;negative
So not just foot injuries.;negative
http://www.newscientist.com/mobile/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed.html;neutral
And yes NYC is safe.;positive
It would be very reasonable to think their strict gun laws help.;negative
Unfortunately you seem allergic to logic.;negative
So you won't put that together.;negative
If you want to discuss how to improve society as a whole I think we need a new thread.;neutral
You say you're not for more guns, isn't keeping guns legal more guns.;negative
You can't possible think the entire supply of legal guns in America would be smuggled across borders?;neutral
And sport shooting and self-defense.;negative
And doomsday preparation.;positive
Not just hunting.;negative
"I know it's .5% of gun owners; perhaps if more people owned guns, more murders and crimes could be prevented.";negative
"And the statistic said, ""at least 0.5% of households had members who had used a gun for defense during a situation in which they thought someone ""almost certainly would have been killed"" if they ""had not used a gun for protection.""";negative
"So actually it's not silly to think all those people would be murdered; murder was actually specifically what the statistic was addressing.";negative
"Your 4.2 statistic does not include injuries, but it's not a survey of gun owners, either; just assault victims.";negative
"In any case, it's still not entirely impressive, just a little more relevant; people who own cars are more likely to be in car accidents than people who don't own cars; people who own toasters are more likely to burn themselves making toast than people who don't own toasters; people who visit the beach frequently are more likely to drown at sea than people who never go to the beach; people who own firearms are more likely to be shot by firearms than people who don't interact with firearms.";negative
Interesting you seem to think NYC is safe... globally it's listed as #7 most victimized city.;negative
So maybe it's not so illogical I link personal safety to having means of self-defense.;negative
Also interesting to note, a lot of the cities with more crime victims are countries with very, very strict gun laws, like Britain.;positive
"We don't need a new thread to discuss how to better society; you specifically said we could better society by handing over our wallets to criminals with guns.";negative
That is very relevant to this debate.;positive
A bit of a tangent, perhaps, but hardly worth starting a whole new debate over.;negative
Keeping things the way they are is keeping things the way they are.;neutral
People crying for gun restrictions are proposing we have less guns.;negative
People who want armed guards posted by every school are asking for more guns.;neutral
"I think we should keep things how they are now; restricted, but still with access.";negative
Why would I think the entire supply of legal guns here is smuggled across boarders?;negative
What did I said to imply that?;neutral
And what, you're just going to ignore the bit about robberies and 67%?;negative
"Haha sneaky, sneaky you; luckily I caught it.";positive
Boars and Angry Deer are sports shooting.;negative
Also self defense is in Ali's do to the 4.2 times statistic remember.;neutral
Also you never said doomsday prepping because if you did I would have made fun of you for it.;negative
Yah thought someone might have been killed.;neutral
Have you listened to yourself lol you think you're going to be killed at every turn.;neutral
It's part of the gun ownership delusion.;neutral
And why is it the gun gets credit for saving you but when it kills someone it doesn't.;negative
All those things are true.;positive
But you don't own a toaster and claim its for self defense.;negative
My entire point is guns don't make you safer.;negative
Call it whatever factor you want.;negative
It's the truth.;neutral
So they're not effective for protection.;negative
See section 1.;positive
You're down to sports shooting and doomsday prepping as your argument.;negative
Seems silly doesn't it.;negative
And again you find a statistic that is obviously flawed to support your case.;negative
NYC is widely considered the safest city in the world.;neutral
You go and find a total number instead of a per capita statistic.;negative
Yes there is probably less crime where you live, there is also 12 million less people.;negative
In Britian a guy might beat the piss out of you.;negative
But there gun deaths are in the low hundred.;negative
AGAIN proving gun laws work.;negative
And if you quote me on everything else and then try to quote me incorrectly.;negative
At least make it bold so your lie looks ok.;neutral
I never said that would make a better society and you know that right.;negative
I said it would be more worth while looking to create a society where people didn't need to rob you.;negative
Instead of just shooting anyone who does.;negative
Keeping things the way they are is more guns then banning guns.;negative
Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.;negative
You can't deny that's you entire thesis here;negative
And the reason I said that is because you didn't acknowledge that banning guns would mean less guns;negative
And I already cited where I got my stat from.;negative
They conflict each other.;neutral
Do we both wanna pretend we know which source is correct.;neutral
Because I'm certain neither of us know.;neutral
Okay, sport shooting and hunting and target practice and self defense and doomsday prep.;negative
"Which is not an invalid reason; governments and countries turn to shit all the time, and it's completely realistic to think that there could come a time when the gov/police are unable or unwilling to protect you or are in fact your biggest threat.";negative
This happens globally and throughout history with the rise and fall of nations.;negative
If some shit like that happens here, chaos and anarchy and riots in the street, it's perfectly reasonable to want some firepower.;negative
Have you listened to yourself?;neutral
You think someone is going to be killed at every turn.;neutral
It's part of the gun ban delusion.;neutral
I brought up the statistic because you said 10,000 deaths are not an acceptable trade off for all of the things owning guns entails.;negative
That includes self-defense.;neutral
But 162,000 lives are saved every year with firearms.;positive
So is 10,000 people dead a good trade off for 162,000 people alive, or would you rather save the 10,000 and let the 162,000 die?;negative
"The gun doesn't get credit for killing someone because you need intent to kill someone and a gun isn't the only way to do it; as a weapon and a visual tool of intimidation a gun can allow someone who otherwise wouldn't have been able to defend themselves to walk out alive.";negative
"You can still kill someone without a gun; your intent is more important than your weapon.";negative
"You cannot always save yourself from someone with a weapon without an equal or better weapon; your weapon is more important than your intent.";negative
"And (I'm going to use the high estimate this time) would you say 972,000 incidents per year that someone saves a live or prevents a murder with a gun means guns are ""not effective for protection?""";negative
Because if almost a million lives saved every year isn't support for keeping guns legal, 10,000 (or whatever % of crime) deaths makes absolutely no case for having them banned.;negative
A total number statistic wouldn't tell me what I need to know.;negative
A per capita statistic analyzes each person and their experiences, and my source found that NYC had more victimized people.;negative
The gun crime rates are low, yes, but crime itself is still prevalent.;negative
Again going back to my assertion that banning guns isn't the same thing as stopping crime.;negative
My point in bringing up Britain was to show that, even without guns, crime still happens.;negative
Banning guns might reduce the number of people killed by guns, but not killed in general.;negative
Kind of like if you banned cars auto-related deaths would drop but bicycle related deaths would go up.;negative
London is a city with next to no guns and a fuckton of people victimized by criminals.;negative
"Perhaps if people in London has the ability to adequately defend themselves; perhaps If a burglar knew breaking into someones flat could very well mean staring down the barrel of a 12gague; perhaps if a mugger knew you could act like you were reaching for your wallet but actually pull out a .22 and shoot his ass; perhaps London would have less crime with more guns.";negative
"Here's what I said the just of your argument was (notice I didn't originally use quotes; I wasn't quoting you, I was summarizing your point): ""We don't need a new thread to discuss how to better society; you specifically said we could better society by handing over our wallets to criminals with guns""";negative
"Here's the direct quote: ""...a criminal with a gun will shoot some dumb John Wayne who thinks he's going to save the day.";negative
"Give then your $40 keep your life and help create a society that doesn't have people who need to rob you instead of arming everyone like its Mad Max.""";negative
"With the exception of ""$40"" and ""wallet"" I don't see a lot of difference between your quote and my summary of it.";negative
Do you?;neutral
How the fuck does that make any sense?;neutral
"If your mom asks if you want second helpings at dinner and you say ""no thanks, I'm okay with what I have on my plate already,"" are you actually asking for ""more food?""";negative
No.;neutral
"I think things should stay the same; we shouldn't be posting armed guards with guns outside schools (more guns) and we shouldn't be banning guns (less guns) we should keep things the same (the same amount of relative gun ownership we currently have).";negative
That's because banning something isn't the same as making it not exist.;negative
Marijuana is illegal, yet it is just as popular and prevalent as alcohol and tobacco, which are legal.;positive
Did banning marijuana make marijuana not exist?;negative
And, arguably, banning something increases use, and certainly makes illegal use less safe.;negative
Look at prohibition.;neutral
You had people going out to illegal clubs to illegally drink illegal booze, people who arguably wouldn't be going out and getting shitfaced if it wasn't illegal, and people who are more likely to get hurt by the illegal alcohol culture that the ban on alcohol created.;negative
"The only statistic I found I justfacts that had 67% in it was: ""Roughly 16,272 murders were committed in the United States during 2008.";negative
Of these, about 10,886 or 67% were committed with firearms.;negative
"[11]""";neutral
"Could you post the exact quote that supports your ""67% of crime is committed with a gun"" statistic?";negative
The thing is, my 8% statistic comes from the same website.;negative
"So unless ""nonviolent crime with a gun"" accounts for 59% of crimes committed with a gun (so not simple/aggravated assaults, robberies, sexual assaults, rapes, and murders), you misquoted your stat.";negative
Ok.;neutral
You don't read well;neutral
I think the world is very safe.;positive
And that's why 10,000 dead people is needless.;negative
And there is no 162,000.;negative
That's 0.5% of the total population.;negative
Which is not the case.;negative
It's 0.5% of gun owners.;negative
Much smaller number.;neutral
Also whose to say because they felt there lives were threatened if they actually were.;neutral
People like you think your life is threatened constantly.;neutral
Pretty flimsy statistic.;neutral
You can't say crime is prevalent in NYC if crime rates are low.;negative
That means crime is not prevalent.;neutral
What is so hard to understand?;negative
And your point about Britian and crime would be valid if the ENTIRE UK had more than 640 murders.;negative
By gun fist knife hammer or otherwise.;neutral
Sounds pretty safe to me.;negative
Anyone with an above gr 8 comprehension would realize that was not my solution.;positive
Your need to harp on this proves how little you have left to stand on.;negative
You can grow Marijuana.;neutral
You let me know when you have a gun plant.;neutral
Also I'm against prohibition.;negative
But there has never been any prof that MORE people drank because of it.;negative
You can't just keep making stuff up.;neutral
I'll catch you.;positive
Banning guns means less guns.;neutral
Keeping them therefore would be more.;neutral
If your mom said no dinner!;neutral
"And you said ""one plate!""";neutral
That would be more than no dinner right?;neutral
It's pretty simple.;positive
You're right.;neutral
The 67% is murders.;negative
Doesn't that still make the point guns don't make us safer.;negative
Even 8% of crime in general is a shit ton.;negative
That's still over 400,000 (8% of 5.1 million) crimes committed with a gun.;negative
I read just fine.;positive
You just explain yourself poorly and don't support your points well.;negative
I also think it's pretty rich you're assuming me of not reading well when you have severely fucked up your reading and understanding of 2 of the statistics in this debate so far.;negative
But 162,000 dead is required?;negative
"And you hardly seem to think the world is a safe place; you seem to think anyone with a weapon is likely to go out and murder everyone.";negative
"The statistic goes as follows: ""A 1993 nationwide survey of 4,977 households found that over the previous five years, at least 0.5% of households had members who had used a gun for defense during a situation in which they thought someone ""almost certainly would have been killed"" if they ""had not used a gun for protection.""";negative
Applied to the U.S. population, this amounts to 162,000 such incidents per year.;negative
"This figure excludes all ""military service, police work, or work as a security guard.""";negative
"[12]""";neutral
So it's not actually .5% of gun owners have used their gun for defense, it's .5% of households have had a member who used a gun to save a life, which when applied to the population comes out to 162,000.;negative
"I would also like to point out that that is 162,000 incidents per year that a gun saves a life; there are 1,029,615 incidents per year (according to the same study) that a gun is used in defense of people or property, but it's hard to tell if someone would have certainly been killed in those incidents.";negative
Because I have statistics that tell me that NYC is the 7th most criminally victimized city in the world, and against that I have your opinion based on spending half the year there.;negative
"By the same study, it's not; it's the most criminally victimized city in the world.";negative
I wasn't just talking about murders I was talking about crime.;negative
"Hahahaha well not all of us are privy to what you were trying to say; all we can examine is what you actually did say.";positive
Again this seems to be a case of you expressing yourself poorly and getting upset when people don't understand.;negative
"I'm all ears; if that's not what you meant to say you can amend your statement and we can discuss that.";negative
"And I'm hardly ""harping on this;"" it account for a very small portion of our debate.";negative
But I think its relevant to see how you handle defeat on the small issues, like this one, because that tells me how you debate in general.;negative
If I win a small point like this and you get butthurt and refuse to explain or support your position, much less admit you were wrong, what does that say about your style of debating as a whole?;negative
Nothing good, that's for sure, and it indicates you wont concede points on the basis that they are your points, not that they are actually correct.;positive
What a spectacular dodge.;positive
Way to completely miss the point in me bringing up weed, man.;neutral
"And you can't keep repetitiously building up your own straw men, passing them off as mine, and then attacking them and thinking you've made a point; I'll catch you.";negative
"I never said there was ""prof"" more people drank (it would have been impossible to calculate, anyways) during prohibition.";negative
I have one gun.;neutral
If a ban on guns goes through and I comply, I will have no guns.;negative
(Less guns);neutral
If things stay the way they are, I will have one gun.;positive
(The same);neutral
If I go buy more gun(s), I will have more than one gun.;negative
(More guns);neutral
Why is this so hard for you to understand?;negative
I stand corrected you do know how to concede a point... kinda.;negative
Lol.;neutral
Well a woefully small percentage of crime is committed with a gun, and even the total amount of that small percentage doesn't compare the the number of times guns are used in self defense, so I think the point can be made that guns make us safer.;negative
The insanity to think that all those people's lives were actually in jeopardy is hilarious.;positive
You're trading REAL lives for hypothetical crime.;neutral
Again!;neutral
Owning a gun makes you 4.5 times more likely to be shot.;negative
Therefore!;neutral
Those 0.5% are still not safer.;negative
While that is a fact, there is no self defense argument.;negative
You Are Not Safer Statistically!;neutral
Also, NYC is the safest city in the world by per capita crime.;negative
Yes there is more crime than Augusta Georgia, but the population is 100 times more.;neutral
You can't refute this.;negative
Like I said about Britian.;neutral
You might catch an ass whooping.;neutral
Which btw has much more to do with the culture than gun laws.;negative
But point is, they don't have guns SO THEY DON'T DIE.;negative
Stats again prove it.;neutral
You have no applicable data that doesn't rely on the opinion of gun owners.;negative
That 0.5% is not a fact.;negative
It's an opinion.;neutral
There is no way to prove there life was in danger.;negative
LOL and the fact you think you've defeated anything is hilarious to me.;negative
You've yet to prove once that guns have helped in any tangible way.;neutral
And I'm not but hurt.;negative
You tried to misrepresent what I said because you have no leg to stand in.;negative
Again on weed.;neutral
You ignore the fact your point is baseless.;neutral
It's a completely different scenario.;neutral
If you could find a proper example you would.;neutral
If you do the math, the amount of crime committed with a gun is much greater.;positive
8% of 51 million crimes is 400,000.;negative
0.5% of imaginary life saving is 162,000.;negative
The numbers are right there for you.;positive
And one of them is based in facts not opinions of already nervous weirdos.;negative
Rob loves to argue, but he's not very good at it.;negative
Come back when you're willing to address all the points I make and not pick and choose certain ones you think you can refute.;neutral
Ignoring the 1,000,000+ statistic, for example (because it is tangible and not reliant on the opinion of gun owners) so you can say my self-defense statistics are based on paranoid delusions.;negative
"You have such an obvious bias against gun owners (thinking being a gun owner makes you a ""nervous wierdo,"" for example) perhaps you ought to work to eliminate that before you can participate in a logical debate about gun facts.";negative
So that stat isn't based on opinion of gun owners?;negative
Explain how.;neutral
Don't throw a fit and runaway.;negative
At least I responded to all of your points.;neutral
Up until now.;neutral
See how you like it, I guess.;positive
That's what happens when your argument is so poor it's impossible to distinguish what is actually a point;neutral
Never mind.;negative
I went back and read all of this.;neutral
You got slammed in this debate.;positive
You should runaway.;neutral
You've never looked up those numbers, have you?;neutral
Most likely got your info at some right wing info outfit.;neutral
Here is the link for those of you who want to look at the numbers for yourselves:;neutral
http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/offenses/expanded_information/data/shrtable_08.html;neutral
Nearly 70% of murders committed in the U.S. are done so using firearms.;negative
The point is people kill people, a weapon is a tool.;negative
Why are there not mass deliberate blue-on- blue shootings in the military??;negative
No he's right.;neutral
8% of total crime is committed with guns.;positive
The around 70%?;neutral
is murders.;neutral
For some reason that makes it better lol.;negative
And btw the 8% if of 51 million crime.;positive
So roughly 400,000 crimes involving guns.;neutral
As opposed to a third that were supposedly stopped by them.;neutral
Clearly it Is NOT the gun.;neutral
So you are telling me that the gun has a mind of its own?;positive
It decides to kill people?;neutral
No.;neutral
Its the person who wields the gun.;neutral
How much more clearly can I state that?;negative
Yah but if they didn't have the gun.;neutral
It would take a lot more to kill someone.;neutral
Guns make it too easy.;negative
And what good do they do.;positive
I could easily kill someone with my finger, or my bare hands.;negative
His point was the intent to murder someone doesn't require a gun to carry out.;neutral
With the chemicals in my house I could make a bomb that would easily blow up a classroom.;negative
With my car I can run someone down and grind them into a pulp.;negative
With my knife I can slice someone to pieces.;positive
If someones wants to murder someone else, they're going to murder them, gun or no, and I think that was his point.;negative
It''s better to regulate the psychos who might kill someone than every little thing they might think to kill someone with.;negative
First of all.;neutral
You could not EASILY kill someone with your fingers, hands, feet or any limb.;negative
It's possible, but pretty fucking far from easy.;positive
And yes you could make a bomb out of chemicals (something that happens far less than shootings) but those chemicals serve others purposes.;negative
Guns only kill things.;neutral
And chemical companies do everything they can to make them safer.;negative
It's not statistically true that without guns, people will kill anyways.;negative
It take FAR more pre meditation to kill someone without a gun.;negative
People make snap bad decisions with guns.;negative
Not really.;neutral
Choking someone to death or stomping their brains out onto the curb has got to be at least as hard as all the work it would take to raise hundreds or thousands of dollars to buy a gun.;negative
Bombings and chemical attacks are more frequent in countries that have banned or severely restricted firearms.;negative
At least compared to here.;neutral
If you take away guns people will still find a way to kill one another.;neutral
So I don't know, would you rather be shot, blown up, or gassed?;negative
You have to pick one, apparently.;positive
It might take a bit more premeditation to kill someone without a gun (unless you happen to have a car or a knife or some wire handy), but I don't know about FAR more.;negative
Really.;neutral
People snap and make bad decisions with their hands and feet, with their knives, cars, etc.;negative
It's realatively easy to kill someone with a finger, you just need to know how.;negative
Well, two fingers actually, sharp jab to the mid-bottom of the throat.;positive
If you tried to kill me with two fingers I'd bludgeon you to the point they couldn't tell who the aggressor was.;negative
Really?;neutral
Then my answer to the debate question is, people should have a psychological profile to show that they are sane before they are allowed a gun.;negative
Lol yeah.;positive
Without a gun it's harder (not impossible) to kill someone.;negative
This way though, the bad people will come into posession with guns that much easier;negative
Wait.;neutral
If we ban guns it will be easier for criminals to get them?;neutral
no, yeah thats what I was trying to say =) sorry for the confusion!;negative
Haha;neutral
If more innocent death is desirable, then it is a brilliant idea.;positive
You're comparing to Mexico, where there is an active cartel war going on.;negative
Ridiculous.;neutral
Try Canada on for size smart guy.;positive
Not comparing anything to Mexico, many people in America get killed because they have no gun whereas the criminal does.;negative
That's not true though.;negative
Owning a gun makes you 88% more likely to be shot.;negative
How does that sound safer?;neutral
Also the Mexico thing was for the guy below you.;neutral
My bad.;neutral
I am glad this discussion was brought up, I strongly disagree that the Government should have the right to ban the sale of guns to the civilians in America.;negative
"The second Amendment gives us the right to ""Bear Arms"".";positive
That is a right that the government has no right to take away.;positive
Their argument is hardly valid, they want to stop the selling of firearms to people because they think it will decrease the crimes and school shootings along with other dangers that are caused by guns.;negative
But it isn't the 'Gun' that is doing the killing!;negative
It its the person who wields the gun!;neutral
They should be the ones taken out of society, not the gun itself.;negative
Do they honestly think getting rid of guns will solve anything?;negative
Granted the fact that the one thing it will be successful in is enraging many Americans.;positive
And since when do Criminals follow the law anyways?;neutral
There is a reason they are criminals!;positive
Banning the sale of guns is not going to stop them!;negative
"If they want to kill they are not going to simply think to themselves ""Oh you know what, guns are banned, therefore I really shouldn't kill all these people"" NO.";negative
That's not how it works.;negative
If they are twisted enough to want to murder people in the first place, then they will find a way around the law.;negative
They could care less about what the government says.;neutral
Americans have the right to own guns.;positive
In fact, the majority of us use them for the GOOD.;neutral
They can actually PROTECT us from those who use them to induce harm.;positive
So that is my opinion.;neutral
And I hope I made it clear, and maybe even brought light to some of you who perhaps didn't look at it this way.;positive
Here is the 2nd amendment in its entirety:;neutral
"""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""";positive
States now have standing armies called the National Guard.;neutral
That nullifies the 2nd amendment.;negative
Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and they look pretty safe.....right?;positive
You're comparing to Mexico, where there is an active cartel war going on.;negative
Ridiculous.;neutral
Try Canada on for size smart guy.;positive
They don't have complete gun control like Mexico Canadians can still own certain types of guns;negative
You are not allowed to carry a firearm in Canada.;negative
It has to be kept in a safe.;neutral
It's as good as banned in Canada.;positive
Well I certainly don't want to live there ill look up their crime stats but it doesn't sound safe;negative
Ya you should look it up.;positive
It'll just go another step to proving your opinion wrong with actual facts.;negative
While we're on the same side here, I feel I have to point out you're a little mistaken here.;negative
No one in Canada is allowed to possess a firearm with the exceptions of the police, government, hunters and so on.;negative
We also happen to be extremely safe, safer than the US I'd say.;negative
Just because we don't have immediate access to guns doesn't make us unsafe in this case, as we're under no real threat at all.;negative
From what I understand Canada is a little different than the US it has a friendlier atmosphere so there is less violent crime.;neutral
In the US if you don't Cary your taken a risk trust me it a'nt all rainbows and kittens down here;negative
Yes, Mexico hes been ranked by the UN as the second most dangerous country right after India!;negative
My point exactly.;neutral
Of course I was being sarcastic but thanks for clearing that up so the liberals didn't get lost;negative
"the bill of rights allows us to ""bear arms"" and therefore the government cannot ban gun sales.";negative
if anybody thinks so then they obviously did not even so much as go to their history class;neutral
more robberies need to end this way http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9z331amWAA;negative
"""A free people ought to be armed.""";neutral
- George Washington;neutral
Democrats need to stop doing this.;negative
He had wooden teeth and believed in slavery.;negative
Should we keep those ideas too?;neutral
Stop looking too 1776 for your advice.;negative
Him having wooden teeth doesn't disqualify people being armed.;negative
Notice you left out the slavery part.;neutral
Very few ideas from 1776 still hold validity today.;positive
I bet almost nothing you do or feel on a daily basis reflects those values.;neutral
You only use them when it serves your flawed argument.;negative
Back then the idea of a free market and economic choice held validity, simply stating that some of those ideas are not longer useful does not make any argument to support an idea from that time period to be invalid.;negative
It would be like claiming that none of Plato's or Socrates' logic has any validity now because they believed in slavery (had it at the time);negative
"Now if you would like to present an actual argument about gun control besides ""that guy has wooden teeth and slaves"" please go ahead and do so.";neutral
First of all.;neutral
Maybe you do live like 1776 because you're boring and take yourself too seriously.;negative
You presented a sentence uttered by a man who owned other men as an argument for gun ownership, not me.;negative
I would never use anecdotal quotes from ghosts as my arguments, you sir are the one who has done this.;negative
I don't think it's irrational to think that getting your gun laws from a time when guns were muskets is naive.;negative
If George Washington were here to see the guns we have now he'd swallow his wooden teeth and shit them out for his slave too clean up.;negative
I quoted someone on gun ownership, NOT slavery, gun ownership is not related to slavery so his position on slavery is meaningless.;negative
Because guns became more high-tech?;neutral
Weaponry becoming more advanced is not grounds to ban it and take it away.;negative
Controlling guns is not being anti-gun, its just centralizing gun power, so instead of citizens and the government being able to defend themselves, only the government can.;negative
At this point the citizens are now dependent on their government for protection and are also at the states absolute mercy considering the people are completely disarmed.;negative
Yah and his views on gun ownership are as irrelevant as his views on slavery.;negative
You are the one that presented them as an argument.;neutral
I pointed out how stupid that was.;negative
And you don't think there is a difference between owning a musket and an assault rifle?;negative
We are at the governments whim regardless.;neutral
You really think because you have a gun, you'd have a chance.;negative
They control water, electricity, and they have more guns then you and all your militia friends could every jerk off too.;negative
It's probably fun to play commando in your head like one day you'll fight off Obama and his evil henchman.;positive
But that's just paranoid delusion.;negative
In the meantime real people are dying for your fantasy.;negative
Stand a chance against the US Marine Corp.?;negative
No.;neutral
Stand a chance against weekend soldiers that make up most of the army?;negative
Actually, yes.;neutral
Its not some fantasy, I've hear this clause before and it basically boils down to this idiotic idea that somehow rebellion is impossible.;negative
People don't die because there are guns, they die because people are violent.;negative
"Millions of people have died over this ""only the government should have guns"" fantasy of yours, that's still leaving out law abiding citizens that are now vulnerable to criminals.";negative
You want to know why burglary rates are low in the US?;negative
Because criminals know that if they break into that house, these is a good chance the owner has a gun and will fight back.;positive
Guns are protection, when they are used violently it is not grounds to take the guns away from everyone else who didn't nothing wrong.;negative
First of all, do you think it would really be weekend warriors.;negative
We don't even use troops to kill people now we use drones strikes.;negative
So you can Will Smith all you want but it's pointless.;negative
And I'm not saying rebellion is impossible.;negative
I'm saying its not necessary.;neutral
Obama isn't out to get you.;negative
And owning a gun doesn't make you safer.;negative
You're 88% more likely to be shot if you own a gun.;negative
Does that sound safe?;neutral
WE are not violent, YOU are violent.;negative
You have violent delusions and the result is far too often a bunch of innocent dead people.;negative
If you believe the government that provides all they do is against you then you can think anyone is.;neutral
Whoever said this is because of Obama?;neutral
And owning a gun does not somehow make you more likely to get shot.;negative
Unless you:;neutral
a. Live in a police state where guns are illegal;neutral
b. Pretend to be the sandy hook shooter;negative
c. Point it at your face;positive
How do I have violent delusions?;neutral
"My ""delusion"" is that people should have the right to bear arms to defend themselves from criminals and if the government becomes brutality violent they can shoot back.";negative
This idea hasn't killed anyone, the idea that guns need to be taken away has left people at the mercy of tyrannical governments and criminals, that has killed people.;negative
And as for drones, drones are expensive and have lots of collateral damage, causing collateral damage (from the government's perspective) on their own land, own people and own means of production is a REALLY fucking stupid idea.;negative
Yes it does make you (88%) more likely to be shot.;negative
You can't say disagree with a statistic with your opinion.;negative
Most people have no idea what they are doing with guns.;neutral
They shoot themselves.;neutral
They commit suicide but most importantly they cause other people who have guns too kill them instead of rob them.;negative
"Which is exactly what happens when you ""defend"" yourself.";neutral
"Someone breaks into your home, you think ""Finally, my chance!""";negative
And as you go for your gun you are killed in the most anti climatic way ever.;negative
That's the fate of your defence.;neutral
The idea you need to protect yourself from the government is the violent delusion.;negative
A) It would obviously be violent if you need guns.;negative
B) The idea you need to battle the government is delusional.;negative
Hence = Violent Delusions;negative
And yes the idea has killed people.;neutral
In fact over 100,000 people in America every year die for your delusion.;negative
And if the government wants you dead and you need guns, why would they give a shit about collateral damage.;negative
You really believe the government is all powerful?;positive
Like if they wanted you dead, they could do it with a snap of their fingers?;neutral
They don't have that power.;negative
They can't just do things whenever they feel like it.;negative
If they did, they would be just like Stalin, Hitler, Mao Ze Dong, Kim Jong Ill/Un, Castro.;negative
They killed more people than the entire holocaust multiplied a few times.;neutral
And EVERY single country they were in didn't allow the citizens to own firearms.;negative
If we are as violent as you say we are, all of you Liberal anti-gunners would be dead a long time ago.;negative
We want to protect your freedoms, even if you don't appreciate it.;negative
The FBI, police, and the states say that letting citizens own guns decreases crime.;negative
There is actually a town in Georgia that requires every one in the town to own a firearm.;positive
Their population tripled in 20 years, their crime went down to almost nothing.;negative
Every single school that allows concealed carry on campus or for the teachers has NEVER had a shooting and crime was reduced.;negative
And you think that we enjoy the chance to kill someone?;neutral
No one wants to kill anybody.;negative
Only the mentally insane and criminals do.;neutral
Killing is not a thing to enjoy nor worship.;negative
It is a deplorable thing.;neutral
I would kill only if that someone threatened my life or that of someone around me.;neutral
And to show in statistics, self-defense cases show only a percentage of less than 1% of people actually pulled the trigger, most just threatened and presented the weapon against the intruder (FBI).;negative
That was enough to scare the criminal.;negative
Please look up facts before making assumptions.;neutral
It shows your ignorance on the matter and the propaganda pumped into you.;negative
The FBI site is a great place to start, as well as the CATO Institue.;positive
Ok so we need to be more free like the non oppressive governments in the Middle East that allow citizens to carry fire arms.;negative
I mean an oppressive government would never allow that right?;neutral
They must have the right idea.;neutral
And as far as the FBI saying that.;neutral
You're just lying lol;negative
http://en.mercopress.com/2009/06/04/new-york-city-remains-the-safest-city-in-united-states-according-to-fbi;neutral
http://online.wsj.com/article/APee79b3d1af8b4e9483a401e655a937e5.html;neutral
It's great to tell someone to go to the FBI site lol I think you should look on google.;neutral
And again it's great to pull a gun on a criminal but its 4.2 times as likely he'll kill you.;negative
So have fun;positive
Yay sources!;positive
I get what they are saying here.;neutral
Maybe stricter gun laws did help, but also the increased activity and push by Police did most of the work.;positive
And your WSJ gave the opinion that the national average of gun crime has gone down, yet gun ownership is up.;negative
And it also stated that the entire thing can't be credited on gun laws.;negative
Health care, decreased poverty, and education were the majority.;negative
I would say that the majority of this was because of the other factors, not gun laws.;negative
Well lets be fair WSJ narrative is going to be pro gun.;positive
It's a Murdoch paper.;neutral
And what about Cananda.;neutral
Why are gun crimes so low?;negative
Friendlier people?;neutral
You're just stating your opinion against facts.;neutral
And wouldn't gun laws mean more police activity anyways.;negative
I like Canadians.;neutral
I've been to the country before.;neutral
You guys have amazing weather.;positive
I like Nova Scotia myself.;negative
We do have amazing weather.;positive
I'm in The Maritimes and it is a mild -35C with the wind chill right now!;negative
Jeez.;neutral
I'm used to Fahrenheit (Murica!);negative
, but damn!;neutral
That's cold.;negative
I would love to see this statistic that you are using as the base of your entire argument.;neutral
"No one says ""oh finally, my chance"" they say ""fuck, someone broke in"" get their gun and shoot at whoever is in the house or just call 911 and protect their kids.";negative
A) If you are just keeping a gun in case something goes wrong, it is not violent.;negative
B) The idea that government will never become oppressive is a delusion.;negative
"The idea that keeping a gun in your home in case you need to protect yourself is ""violent"" is delusional.";negative
100,000 a year?;neutral
http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm I think not...;neutral
For a few reasons:;neutral
A) They kill anyone near you, you can rest assure that some of their friends/family will take up arms against whatever force killed them.;negative
B) Since it would be a rebellion in America, it is in the American Government's best interest not to destroy their own infrastructure and industry.;negative
C) Drone warfare is extremely unpopular among most of the world, difference is that in Afghanistan when a kid gets killed it goes un-reported, in the developed world if a reporter gets a hold of that it can change the rest of the world's view on the situation.;negative
The 88% stat is from a documentary so I can't post it.;neutral
But here's the first thing that comes up when you look at subject.;neutral
A study that finds you're 4.2 more likely to be murder by a gun and 4.5 times more likely to be shot.;negative
Feel safer?;neutral
http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed.html;neutral
You aren't keeping a gun in case something goes wrong.;negative
You are keeping a gun to fight the government.;neutral
And of course governments can become dangerous, that's why we keep a strong democracy.;positive
You think guns protect that you're insane.;neutral
If there was a vote.;neutral
And the majority said they wanted to ban guns.;neutral
What would you think then?;neutral
And using a stat on murder has nothing to do with gun crime.;negative
A kid who finds his dads gun and kills himself isn't a murder.;negative
The last part of you argument makes it sound like you think the government is targeting you specifically.;positive
I wish I had the list to out people like you on.;negative
I don't get the logic.;negative
The government is attacking us but they are doing it politely without anyone noticing?;negative
What are you talking about.;neutral
The thing is, some of histories most violent and oppressive governments are democratically elected.;negative
The Nazis are a good example, Ancient Rome also.;positive
Yah but isn't it pretty obvious we aren't that?;negative
It's scary to think anyone thinks we are.;neutral
The fear is that we could turn into that.;neutral
Its why the founding fathers wanted to create a Republic, not a democracy.;neutral
Republic is ruled by law, a Democracy by majority.;negative
A straight Democracy is 2 wolves and a sheep voting for who's dinner.;negative
A law prohibiting the wolves to vote on eating the sheep is the best.;positive
That was over 200 years ago.;neutral
Why do we want to live like we did the.;negative
Things are different.;neutral
We came here on boats and people died from colds.;negative
It's a different world.;neutral
Lets make laws that apply to this world, not the one we bought with beaver pelts.;negative
And in most cases your right.;positive
Except kids are dying so the sheep can have his gun.;neutral
Almost any other situation you're dead on.;negative
This one has too much blood on it;negative
Oh, the government tried to stop him.;negative
They swore that a gun-fee zone and security doors and cameras would stop him.;negative
But it didn't.;neutral
Maybe if a teacher had a gun?;neutral
"""Despite the US having the highest rate of firearms-related homicide in the industrialized world"" Oh really, what about Russia and Brazil, they both have stricter gun control laws http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-perspective/011613-640869-more-guns-means-less-crime.htm?p=full";neutral
Yes, I am keeping a gun in case something goes wrong, being open to the fact that government can become dangerous does not mean I am plotting a rebellion.;negative
We keep guns not so we can run around shooting criminals and brutal police officers, we keep them in case we have to do with violent criminals and oppressive governments.;negative
Gun owner =/= rebel;neutral
We don't have a democracy we have republic, a democracy would be terrible.;negative
Although Republics are safer than other forms of government, again I encourage you to have some knowledge of history, republics have been over thrown or taken over.;negative
"As Mao Zedong says ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.""";negative
just so happened that his regime was the only one with guns, look how that turned out.;negative
The same thing I thought when the majority was dumb enough to give Bush and Obama two terms, its a stupid idea.;negative
The majority at times (in most cases) can be really dumb and mislead, that is why we have a constitution, to protect people from politicians abusing power (ex: Taking away freedom of speech and press);negative
Its suicide, you don't need a gun to kill yourself, drink bleach, jump of a bridge, take 60 triple C's, crash your car, run onto a high way, slit your throat with a knife, run out onto a frozen lake etc.;positive
I never said or acted like they were targeting me specifically, maybe you should re-read my argument.;negative
You don't seem to get it, now please, instead of just trying to twist this into me being paranoid, actually read what I say:;negative
When a government is fighting a civil war it is in their best interest to end it quickly and with little damage.;positive
Collateral damage would destroy industry and infrastructure, anyone accidental killed in the collateral damage will server as something for other people to rally around.;negative
"It works the same way in Afghanistan, they use a drone to kill one ""terrorist"" they injure/kill a kid that was near the explosion, now his parents and friends will most likely take up arms.";negative
Are you starting to understand?;neutral
Collateral damage works against them, it takes out 1 threat but at the same time has a large potential to create more (especially in a urban area) and at the same time it is damaging their own infrastructure and industry.;negative
Its not about being polite, its about fighting smart, using drones would not be a good move.;neutral
First of all.;neutral
I didn't say the first part lol.;neutral
But to address it.;positive
Is Brazil or Russia really anywhere near on par with America.;negative
If that's the living standard you want.;neutral
Have at it.;neutral
I'll tell you what.;positive
You come up with something that happened this century as a basis for your argument and I'll take you seriously.;positive
So you say all this about how te government would fight us smart.;neutral
But you'd rebel right.;positive
So do you assume they let you win?;negative
They don't want collateral damage but if that's what it took to run through you.;neutral
They'd do it.;neutral
Starting to understand?;neutral
I don't assume they would let whoever is rebelling win, however, they understand what collateral damage does.;negative
They can either send in the army or militia and fight whoever is rebelling or use drones.;neutral
When they kill people who weren't involved, destroy infrastructure and roads it hurts them more.;negative
"I'm not saying ""well, the government will fight gentleman's style"" I'm saying that any somewhat intelligent military understand who this works.";negative
"As for the whole ""this century"" thing that is only a 13 year period, so that kind of gets Hitler, Stalin, Zedong, Pol etc.";negative
But anyway, what about the Winnende Shooting in Germany?;neutral
They have have very strict gun control laws.;neutral
Brazil and Russia are both modern industrialized nations.;positive
"""Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""";neutral

"No they aren't. """;negative
"Those who use no common sense and logic are bound to make stupid decisions"" -Rob Mailloux";neutral
People only look to history when it serves their purpose;neutral
Please tell that to Napoleon and Hitler when they tried to invade Russia.;neutral
They didn't learn history very well when the Teutonic Knights invaded Novgorod.;negative
Napoleon was a smart guy, he was one of the greatest generals in all time.;positive
But he didn't follow history's example.;neutral
And his army was almost wiped out by a fierce Russian Winter.;negative
Same thing for Hitler (though he wasn't a smart guy).;negative
But instead of reading history to find an obscure example they could have just looked up how fucking cold it is in Russia.;negative
Napoleon couldn't have gotten accurate weather predictions, it was the 1800's.;negative
And even in the 1940's it was hard to predict.;negative
And I think several thousand Teutonic Knights is not very obscure.;negative
It is one of the most recorded battles in history.;neutral
The name has slipped my mind though.;positive
Lol if the name slipped your mind then you can't expect a busy guy like Napolean or Hitler to remember.;negative
And the point is, we're smarter than history now.;positive
Things are different.;neutral
We have weather reports so we don't make those mistakes.;negative
That's exactly my point.;neutral
Worth saying that banning guns from a society used to them is no t same thing as looking at countries that never had generalized possession of personal weapons.;positive
Banning guns in America would probably lead to more crime.;negative
If we ban guns they will just move to a black market, and then we cant track them.;neutral
"You mean like when criminals steal ""legal"" guns from dummies.";neutral
No when smuggling rings and the like get them .;neutral
True.;neutral
Probably the same smugglers that smuggle guns now right?;neutral
I'm not even going to go into what the constitution says.;negative
We all have lives we want to keep, weather it's ours or someone else's.;negative
Having a gun as a weapon is what keeps us safe.;positive
Yes there are people who have them who do bad.;negative
Even if you make guns illegal do you think no civilian will get one?;negative
Some drugs are illegal yet people still use them.;neutral
Making guns illegal to the public won't change anything.;negative
Actually it will make things worse because the people with good intentions with them won't be able to have them when they need them.;negative
Owning a gun makes you 88% more likely to be killed by one.;negative
Feel safer now?;neutral
We all have to go sometime.;negative

"Life became so much more simple once I made the concious decision that I have no intention of living forever ;)";neutral
Okay, that's totally correct.;positive
I fully support that and it actually makes sense.;positive
Apparently the number of civilians that own guns in the US is 270 million.;negative
COME ON GUYS!;neutral
Thank you for the logic here.;positive
He keeps trying to sneak things by.;negative
It shows his argument is falling apart.;negative
Why try to fuck the #'s to support yourself if you didn't think you we're losing.;negative
What makes you say that?;neutral
You can say any number to me but you've given me no proof to back that up.;negative
No.;neutral
The problem is not guns and school shootings are not that common compared to car accidents.;negative
Should we ban cars?;neutral
The problem is crazy people and there are better solutions than banning guns.;negative
One possible solution is to require guns be kept in a safe when the owner is not near them.;neutral
If a gun gets stolen because the owner was at work and the gun was not in a safe, for example, and the gun is used in a violent crime, the owner is liable.;negative
That is much simpler to implement and more effective since the number of guns in this country is astronomical and the black market will always be able to smuggle guns into the country.;positive
"But hey..., that's just me ;)";positive
Where is the evidence that banning guns doesn't help.;negative
Look at New York City.;neutral
Is statistically the safest city in America now and it has a the strictest gun laws in the country.;neutral
Where's the evidence to back up your statement?;neutral
"I'll show you mine if you show me yours ;)";neutral
Is the FBI a good enough source?;neutral
http://en.mercopress.com/2009/06/04/new-york-city-remains-the-safest-city-in-united-states-according-to-fbi;neutral

"Oh..., you took me at my word..., you must be new ;)";negative
Actually..., I lived in N.Y.;negative
"The only reason it's safe is because everyone thinks everyone else is crazy ;)";negative
Oh you didn't hear.;neutral
I'm the new celebrity here.;neutral
Comic from Canada who takes things too seriously.;neutral
I was told by the guy who runs the site to check you out.;negative
Cool.;positive
"So..., say something funny ;)";positive
"New York's secret to gun violence is cops, not laws ;)";negative
New York enforces the gun laws that every state has more effectively, by using more cops in crime areas, it has nothing to do with banning guns.;negative
A 1982 survey of male felons in 11 state prisons dispersed across the U.S. found:;negative
"• 34% had been ""scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim""";negative
"• 40% had decided not to commit a crime because they ""knew or believed that the victim was carrying a gun""";negative
"• 69% personally knew other criminals who had been ""scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim"" crime prevention at its finest";negative
Your citing felons, on stats on people not committing crime?;negative
Do you realize how stupid that is.;negative
its felons stating that they or others they know have been stoped from commiting a crime by a gun.;negative
not stupid at all really;negative
But theyre felons.;neutral
So loose gun laws obviously didn't stop them dummy.;negative
That's why they're felons.;negative
i didnt say they did I. this illistaites how people owning guns stoped them from commiting crimes.;negative
guns = crime control;neutral
IT DIDN'T STOP THEM.;negative
THEY STILL COMMITED CRIME.;neutral
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE FELONS;negative
it didnt the last time but they all said there was a time or multiple other times when it did.;negative
http://www.justfacts.com/guncontrol.asp#crime heres the website i got those numbers from go check it out for yourself;neutral
Also I cited the FBI.;negative
This is some fri he conservative website.;neutral
Hardly unbiased lol;negative
"really ""justfacts"" is bias really.";negative
the world must be great through you eyes i've never seen rainbows or unicorns farys, or leperchons.;neutral
but in you story book world i bet you have;neutral
Congrats.;positive
You spelt one of the three of those words correctly.;positive
oh i'm sorry but are we argueing the marits of gun control or are we in english class?;negative
Lol you're right.;positive
Your point in leprechauns and unicorns had a lot to do with gun control.;negative
The point is.;neutral
You're not ver intelligent.;negative
Which explains why you have a warped idea of what the world really is.;negative
Also why facts don't seem to phase you.;negative
oh right it didnt occure to me that you might not be able to comprehend sarcasm let me explain clears throught me call you delusional it funny round about way.;neutral
you catch all that sport?;neutral
ill try to keep it at your level from now on.;neutral
That's not even what sarcasm is lol.;negative
Like I get you didn't think I saw real unicorns.;negative
But you clearly don't know what sarcasm actually is.;negative
How old are you?;neutral
Sarcasm is when you attempt to insult someone in a way that is less than obvious thus keeping them oblivious to the insult and there by adding even further to it by making them look stupid.;negative
And my age is not your concern;negative
That's not sarcasm.;negative
Also was saying I see fairy's your attempt at not obviously insulting me??;negative
Lol you're truly awful.;negative
And btw.;positive
"Just because they call something ""just facts"" doesn't mean it Isn't biased.";negative
The conservative paper is called the Sun.;neutral
It doesn't make it the actual sun.;negative
there's also information that could be used to support gun control arguemnts.;negative
its just theres more evidence against it because more evedence exsists that refuts it than supports.;negative
PS when did you quote the FBI the only facts i remember you bringing to the tabe are that Britain and canada have gun control;negative
So you're admitting there is less evidence to support you the help lol?;negative
The 4.2 times more likely to be shot than those not carry a weapon is from the FBI.;negative
No I was saying there's less evidence to support YOUR side not mine;negative
Also I never mentioned Britain.;negative
You just created that in your mind.;positive
I said NYC.;neutral

i've got news hear about gun control in england.;neutral
it seems they dont like it http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKdBxpKqUvs;negative
Jesus.;neutral
Did you just use something from info wars as an actual opinion of people in England?;negative
I suppose you believe in reptilian shape shifters as well?;neutral
Crazy person.;neutral
Reptilian shape what?!?!;neutral
I haven't the slightest clue as to what you are talking about I got that vid from YouTube you dolt;negative
It's a video from Alex Jones.;neutral
How much more bias could it be.;neutral
Dolt.;neutral
No!;neutral
"Banning the sales of guns to civilians will only make it that much easier for criminals and ""Adam Lanza"" type people to obtain them.";negative
In reality, there is not a lot of shootings, we hear about them BECAUSE they are rare.;negative
Giving guns to good people can protect families and CHILDREN from bad people;negative
If the government decides to take guns away it will more than likely cause a civil war or a revolution and I doubt most of the people in the military want guns taken away, so who is the government going to have take the guns away?;negative
And there's always room in the black market for guns.;neutral
Well, guns should not be banned for the same reason people need them for many guns are used for protection.;negative
Some people say that guns should be banned but what difference will it make.;neutral
Most of the people who do bad with guns get them illegally so what difference will it make if guns are banned.;negative
Both those who do bad and who do good with it will have to get it illegally and our crime rate will increase rappidly.;positive
No way!;neutral
there is a law in the constitution in the second amendment saying that all men have a right to take up arms.;neutral
Banning guns wont do anything except create more trouble.;negative
When things become banned or not made anymore they become more valuable, which means more and more people are going to want them.;neutral
Not every killer uses an AR-15 to kill some one thats just what everyone has in mind as a killer weapon.;negative
Anyway if they did ban guns from people who go and get a background check to get one, what would stop people who buy or get the guns free from the black market, nothing.;negative
If someone wanted to kill a shit load of people in a classroom they could do it easily by like picking up a pair of scissors and killing them.;negative
nothing will stop killing, death is everywhere, everyday is a chance you may die or live that simple;negative
Guns are an important part of life in America.;positive
Just because a select few have mental problems and go off killing people, it does not mean all target shooters, hunters, and gun owners should be penalized.;negative
Currently there are tons upon tons of gun laws already in place that make it difficult to purchase fire arms (at least here in Connecticut).;negative
The U.S. Government just needs to enforce the laws that are already in place.;negative
F.Y.I here in Connecticut we have some of the strictest gun laws in the country and the Newtown shooting still happened.;neutral
Its not the guns that kill people, its the people who use them.;negative
If we want to loose more lives fine.;neutral
Chichago IL has strict gun rules, the people can't have them, and they have a very bad crime rate.;negative
Other cities, that are big in size, have no gun restrictions and a low crime rate.;negative
See the connection?;positive
Definitely no!!!;negative
Yes, guns help kill people, but one of the things stated in the constitution was the right to bear arms, and you cannot go back on it!!!;negative
just found this website info is supper helpfull some is a little dated but not too much so 80s at the oldest http://www.justfacts.com/guncontrol.asp#crime;negative
The best part about that is you glossed over all the info that completely refutes everything you're saying.;negative
If only 0.5% of the population has ever used a gun to prevent a robbery then they aren't doing shit.;negative
Consider 67% of crime is committed with a gun.;negative
That's a pretty awful fucking trade;negative
yes 67% of crime IS commited with a gun this is true but most of those guns are usually obained illegaly;negative
i didnt gloss over any thing i just copyd it there and pasted it here.;negative
0.5% of only 4,977 houses hardlly the whole country my friend;negative
Ok.;neutral
So that's an inaccurate sample size?;neutral
So the stat means nothing lol.;negative
It was your stat.;neutral
The stat was meant to show you that guns DO have an actual self defense role.;neutral
What the stat shows me is that the trade off between 67% of crime being committed with guns and 0.5% being stopped by them.;neutral
Is a terrible trade off.;negative
Yes but most guns used in crimes are obtained illegally so what would gun control do to stop that?;negative
Nothing it would just leave the good guys defenseless.;negative
Most illegal guns are stolen from people who obtained them legally.;neutral
So if they didn't have them.;neutral
Neither would the criminals.;neutral
Actually there's this whole crime called illegal gun trafficking where guns are sold to,criminals under the table and with no serial number so the gun cannot be traced to any one so even if guns are made illegal that will still continue to happen face it your argument is doomed to fail simply because its inescapably based on the naive premiss that criminals follow the law.;negative
With they don't by the way hence the name criminal;neutral
I'll say it again.;neutral
"A great deal of ""illegal"" guns were obtained legally then stolen.";positive
Meaning if they weren't obtained legally.;neutral
They wouldn't be available illegally.;negative
There is gun smuggling sure.;neutral
A small part of the overall picture, but why not make a huge improvement.;negative
I've already proved guns don't make you safer.;negative
So what argument do you have that they serve any purpose?;neutral
You do know percentages don't go up when you increase the sample size right?;neutral
Look if they had done a nation wide study I'm sure that number would have been higher because they would have been working with more people.;neutral
What I'm saying is they only chose to work with a small chunk of people so of that small chunk only 0.5% had used a gun in defense of their or another's life but if they had broadened their servay they may have talked to more who had also used a gun in defense of there or another's life and the percentage should have been higher;negative
Do you not get how percentages work?;negative
It wouldn't have been higher.;negative
It would have been 0.5% of a larger sampling.;negative
You're just presuming it would be more.;negative
It could easily have been less.;negative
That's why you take sample sizes.;neutral
0.5% is the number.;neutral
67% of crime is committed with a gun.;positive
End of story.;neutral
Guns obtained illegally.;neutral
Because then they can't be traced to the user legal sales have no effec on crime period.;negative
That is a great website, thanks.;positive
But hey, guns are dangerous.;negative
I have to say.;neutral
"Theodore Roosevelt said it best ""the rifle is like the ballot in that its usefulness relies soully apon the character of the user""";negative
If you want civilians to be defenseless in the event of armed conflict, then yes.;negative
Otherwise, no.;negative
The thing that I find to be most ridiculous about this hotly-debated issue is the idea that it's better for guns to be in the government's hands then regular civilians...as if government officials have a different moral fabric than a regular civilian.;negative
Who's to say that if the government has most / all of the guns they won't use them for evil?;neutral
History shows how ridiculous that idea is.;negative
Trying to get all gun away from the people will just start riots and it well turn into a civil war millions of people well get killed.;positive
"1) It's a violation of the constitution; which in itself is illegal (2nd amendment )";negative
2) This would probably create a multi billion dollar black market industry for guns all over America, while giving criminals more power too.;negative
3) Personally I think it's not the guns themselves but the overall accessibility and lack of safety measures (background checks...etc) we have that really gets people killed.;negative
Disarmed People = Are Dominated People;neutral
Simple as that so do we really want to ban guns?;negative
The best way to control a person is to take their guns away.;positive
While I do not like guns and do not desire to own one, an outright ban wouldn't be constitutional, it probably wouldn't prevent criminals from obtaining them illegally, and legal availability of guns is not a primary factor in determining violent crimes.;negative
The only form of increased gun regulation I support is applying state regulations to gun shows.;negative
You shouldn't find it easier to purchase a gun at a gun show then at a gun store in the same state.;negative
The job of the government is to protect the people and pass laws and regulations that support and uphold the constitution.;negative
While many will say that guns are dangerous, it is simply a constitutional right that the government must protect.;positive
To completely ban the sale of guns to citizens would take away a key right given to us in the constitution and would lead us down a dangerous road.;negative
That being said, I am all for increasing the background checks and strengthening the process to get guns.;negative
But completely banning them is not going to happen.;negative
Guns Cause War;neutral
So 10,000 dead people so you can shoot Boar.;negative
Got it;neutral
4.2 times more likely to be shot was a statistic from the FBI.;negative
And it's completely relative to the argument.;positive
You say owning a gun makes you safer, from crime and what not.;negative
But it doesn't, it makes you 4.2 times more likely to be harmed.;negative
So you can't use defense as an argument.;negative
I spend half my year in NYC.;neutral
Hardly Suburbia.;negative
Safe city though.;neutral
Might have to do with the strict gun laws.;neutral
That's not the way we create a society where people don't need to rob you.;negative
Simply pointing out our efforts maybe better served creating that world instead of shooting anyone who plans to commit crime.;neutral
When kids get molested nobody says we should get more pedophiles.;negative
That's exactly the line of thinking you're subscribing too.;negative
The difference in our stats is that you tried to sneak violent crime in as the same thing.;negative
Clever, but I noticed.;positive
really that would only leave murder and pistol whipping.;negative
Most violent crime is abuse or assault.;negative
67% of crime includes robbery's and such.;negative
You know, the thing that happened to you.;neutral
In Britian a guy might beat the piss out of you.;negative
But there gun deaths are in the low hundred.;negative
AGAIN proving gun laws work.;negative
And if you quote me on everything else and then try to quote me incorrectly.;negative
At least make it bold so your lie looks ok.;neutral
I never said that would make a better society and you know that right.;negative
I said it would be more worth while looking to create a society where people didn't need to rob you.;negative
Keeping things the way they are is more guns then banning guns.;negative
Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime.;negative
You can't deny that's you entire thesis here;negative
And the reason I said that is because you didn't acknowledge that banning guns would mean less guns;negative
And I already cited where I got my stat from.;negative
They conflict each other.;neutral
Do we both wanna pretend we know which source is correct.;neutral
Because I'm certain neither of us know.;neutral
Ok.;neutral
You don't read well;neutral
I think the world is very safe.;positive
And that's why 10,000 dead people is needless.;negative
And there is no 162,000.;negative
That's 0.5% of the total population.;negative
Which is not the case.;negative
It's 0.5% of gun owners.;negative
You can't say crime is prevalent in NYC if crime rates are low.;negative
That means crime is not prevalent.;neutral
What is so hard to understand?;negative
And your point about Britian and crime would be valid if the ENTIRE UK had more than 640 murders.;negative
By gun fist knife hammer or otherwise.;neutral
Sounds pretty safe to me.;negative
Anyone with an above gr 8 comprehension would realize that was not my solution.;positive
Your need to harp on this proves how little you have left to stand on.;negative
You can grow Marijuana.;neutral
You let me know when you have a gun plant.;neutral
But there has never been any prof that MORE people drank because of it.;negative
You can't just keep making stuff up.;neutral
I'll catch you.;positive
Banning guns means less guns.;neutral
Keeping them therefore would be more.;neutral
You're right.;neutral
The 67% is murders.;negative
Doesn't that still make the point guns don't make us safer.;negative
Even 8% of crime in general is a shit ton.;negative
That's still over 400,000 (8% of 5.1 million) crimes committed with a gun.;negative
The idea you need to protect yourself from the government is the violent delusion.;negative
A) It would obviously be violent if you need guns.;negative
B) The idea you need to battle the government is delusional.;negative
And yes the idea has killed people.;neutral
In fact over 100,000 people in America every year die for your delusion.;negative
And if the government wants you dead and you need guns, why would they give a shit about collateral damage.;negative
You aren't keeping a gun in case something goes wrong.;negative
You are keeping a gun to fight the government.;neutral
And of course governments can become dangerous, that's why we keep a strong democracy.;positive
You think guns protect that you're insane.;neutral
f there was a vote.;negative
And the majority said they wanted to ban guns.;neutral
What would you think then?;neutral
And using a stat on murder has nothing to do with gun crime.;negative
A kid who finds his dads gun and kills himself isn't a murder.;negative
The last part of you argument makes it sound like you think the government is targeting you specifically.;positive
I wish I had the list to out people like you on.;negative
I don't get the logic.;negative
The government is attacking us but they are doing it politely without anyone noticing?;negative
What are you talking about.;neutral
Sure!;neutral
There are too many kids as it is in schools.;negative
Making assault weapons available to Americans seems like a highly effective way of culling the child population.;negative
I really hope people can see the sarcasm in this.;positive
Well I guess it depends on what you want to use it for.;negative
I know some people who just shoot trees or targets they make.;negative
Most people just like to brag about their guns and may never use them.;negative
Some just think guns are better than a simple vase or a picture.;negative
My dad loves guns and he only plays with one.;neutral
The rest just sit in his room.;negative
They are unloaded but they can be used.;neutral
He just lets them collect dust.;negative
Assault weapons don't always have to actually be used.;negative
I don't see why not.;negative
They are used in a fraction of a percent of crimes, and they are a lot of fun.;positive
Constitution my anus.;negative
The Second Amendment has to be modified.;neutral
Assault weapons spell danger.;neutral
YellThe USA has one of the worst Gun Laws in the Planet.;negative
How the hell does military guns reach common people.;negative
We need to make our gun Laws similar to Japan's.;negative

Further, lets say we eliminated not just all assault weapons, but tall rifles.;negative
Lets even stipulate that the banning of these weapons would be effective (how well has that worked out for marijuana or alcohol?);negative

It must be sad for you that other countries can manage without guns but yet not the USA.;negative

It must be sad that you can't ever continually dispute my other arguments.;negative
Probably because you're just constantly wrong.;negative

it doesn't matter it are right and we should get to keep are guns.;negative
I don't use my guns on anything but I still just like having them.;negative
Well the rest of the world can manage without guns but apparently they need guns in the USA to protect against other people with guns so let them at each other.;neutral
As long as they don't involve any other more civilised countries.;neutral
Yeah... because NO other countries have guns, right?;negative
A gun having a stock and a black paint job doesn't make it military grade weaponry.;negative
NO!!!!;neutral
Gun laws are perfectly fine as is.;positive
Besides, these laws are protected by default under our Constitution's 2nd Amendment:;negative

Guns are just inanimate objects.;neutral
People kill people…guns don’t kill people.;neutral

Lets focus on fixing the root of America's core problems: the mental health crisis, stop letting prisoners out of prison, stronger parental control over their children playing violent video games and TV, fixing our broken judicial system, and the list goes on and on.;negative
Besides…even if all guns were confiscated by the government, tens of thousands of illegal guns will still be easily attainable via the black market and the cartels.;negative
As I said in dispute and as another poster already mentioned, this is a non-factual argument.;negative
In the U.S., firearms are far, far more commonly used to prevent crime than to commit it.;negative

They are not sport.;neutral

They do horrific damage in the hands of the wrong people.;negative
Too often we have seen this happen.;neutral
The only reason the NRA is opposed is because gun manufacturers don’t want sales to go down.;negative
But that wouldn’t be a good argument, so the NRA fires people up by saying banning assault weapons is against the second amendment.;negative
Consider the likelihood of 1) another mass murder or 2) government confiscating weapons.;negative
Which do you think is most likely to happen in the next year?;neutral
Another mass murder of course.;negative
Actually, five people were shot and killed in Seattle today (4/22/13).;negative
I’m not willing to risk innocent lives just so some good ol’ boy can look like a hot shot with a big weapon.;negative
Allowing assault weapons is playing with fire.;negative
There is already too much gun violence in America.;negative
People never see the dangers in banning assault riffles.;negative
For example, what would happen if we banned guns and then were faced with a zombie apocalypse?;neutral
We would be screwed.;negative
We need out assault riffles.;negative
";)";neutral
Yeah what if there were more then 10 or 20 people...or zombies trying to attack you.;neutral
I feel we should legalize all the guns or ban all the guns, and since banning all the guns is unconstitutional I'm on this side.;negative
I mean a gun is a gun is a gun, if a pistol wielder can pop off six shots in under a minute that's potentially six people dead, in under an hour.;negative
Which is bad.;negative
So taking their assault rifles will just be lessening the blow only slightly, but bad none the less.;negative
Bad equals bad, so it won't make a difference.;negative
2nd amendment states we have the right to bear arms and what is an assault weapon, A GUN.;negative
So they should and always should be legal to own.;negative
If some people wanna be stupid and shoot someone that did nothing fine then take their rights away but not all the others who are responsible gun owners.;negative
Should firearms of the above description should be banned in the USA?;negative

What about the case in that school with Adam Lanza.;neutral

Ban or not, criminals can still get guns.;negative
The only true way to fight this crime is to prevent yourself from being a victim and investing in a firearm to protect yourself/family.;negative
Guns have become a way of lifestyle and major hobby and a ban would impact their lives greatly.;positive
Countries that have introduced strict gun bans and gun control showed increases (major increase) in crime and homicides.;negative
To summarize it all: guns or not, people will still kill people.;neutral
So, in layman's terms, nut up or shut up.;neutral
If firearms were banned, then that would be a direct violation of the 2nd amendment.;negative
It would also create a larger black market for guns, therefore the taxpayers would end up paying for more regulation and more trials.;negative
Keep guns.;neutral
It is a right not a privilege.;neutral
Guns don't kill people, people do.;neutral
They shouldn't because gun control will not stop criminals from going out to buy those guns illegally.;negative
And having a gun in the house with a certified person could mean the difference between life and death.;negative
So no we shouldn't ban guns.;negative
UK - NO guns, less crime.;neutral
.;neutral
Yet it has a smaller population.;neutral
More CCTV cameras to catch criminals.;negative
UK women are twice as likely to get raped as in America.;negative
Gun crime increased in some towns.;negative
Less in some, more in others.;negative
Nice try;neutral
2002;neutral
UK - 81 people shoot;neutral
USA - 30,242 people shot.;positive
USA has 5x more people but even after correcting numbers it's still 73x more than in UK.;negative
Rape statistics are pretty equal.;positive
You said there were no guns in UK, yet people still get shot.;negative
Tell me again how banning guns works.;negative
81 is less than 30,242.;negative
Does that help clarify?;neutral
After over a century of gun control 81 should be 0.;negative
81 is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more than 0.;negative
So just because it's not perfect, that means it doesn't work?;negative
That is not why it doesn't work.;negative
It isn't that it isn't perfect, it's the fact that guns aren't in control.;negative
Over a hundred years ago when guns were legal, there was 1 gun death per year.;negative
Now it is 81.;neutral
Gun deaths have gone up and gun control has been in place.;negative
That should be an indicator that it isn't working.;negative
Gun are largely under control.;negative
They just aren't as under control as we'd like.;negative
It still clearly makes a difference to how many people are killed by guns each year.;neutral
You must surely see this as a positive thing.;positive
As for your second point: 100 years ago the UK had half the population so that explains why there would be at least double the number of shootings now.;negative
Guns are also more accurate, shooters are more likely to get caught, deaths from gun are more likely to be registered.;negative
This all goes to show why you'd expect there to be 81 deaths in the last year compared to 1 gun death per year 100 years ago.;negative
This is kind of avoiding that 1 gun death per year 100 years ago is probably a completely invented figure.;neutral
That's why the laws keep getting updated and nobody is safer.;negative
So, since population doubled it's ok for gun deaths to increase 80x.;neutral
That's a little bit more than double.;neutral
England is notorious for underreporting gun deaths.;negative
The 81 is probably made up as well, but since it supports your view it's ok.;neutral
I don't see reducing gun deaths as a positive thing.;negative
More people die overall when gun deaths are reduced.;negative
You support more dead people.;neutral
"Okay if you want the want statistics: 0.04/100,000 homicide by gun-fire per population where by gun in 2011 according to the ""European Detailed Mortality Database"" complied by the World Health Organisation.";negative
Compared to 3.2/100,000 in 2010 in USA (reported in the National Vital Statistics Volume 30, number 3, December 29, 2011).;negative
Tell me how England is underreporting gun deaths exactly?;negative
Do you have any evidence for that?;neutral
You think if we find someone that has died of a gun wound then we just don't do a death certificate?;neutral
We throw the body away as part of some conspiracy?;neutral
Get real, its not the sort of thing you can cover up.;negative
Again, any evidence to support that?;neutral
Our overall homicide rate is much lower than yours too.;negative
UK: 1.2/100,000 USA: 4.8/100,000.;negative
As you're no doubt aware, more than half of homicides in the USA are by a gun, which helps to explain the USA's rate being much higher.;negative
Oh really?;neutral
How about the fact that a triple homicide in England would be reported as one murder thus less gun deaths reported.;neutral
How do you like them apples?;neutral
You would like to think so, but the murder rate is higher in the USA in the parts of the country with gun control.;negative
You have 0 proof that gun control is the reason that England has less murder.;negative
England has always had a lower murder rate than USA.;negative
The murder rate for England shows an upward trend over the last decades and USA is on a downward trend.;negative
How do you explain that?;neutral
How do you explain that the murder rate is 4 times higher in USA, but only half is because of guns.;neutral
What is your explanation for USA having twice as many non gun deaths?;neutral
We have implemented gun control in the USA and it does not work, more people die.;negative
Do you have any statistics from before and after gun regulation.;neutral
Murder goes up when gun control is introduced.;neutral
Look at the murder rate for England in 1998 after gun regulation was added in 1997.;negative
Unfortunately for you I'm a law student so you can't bullshit your way through this argument.;negative
You're correct that if someone is convicted of a triple murder then then it could (maybe) me reported as one crime if they were rather crudely judging it from the number of criminals.;negative
However, the statistics for the number of people killed by guns is compiled by the death certificates, not the crime records.;neutral
If you cite the regulation (and the stats) then I'll look at it.;negative
As far as I'm aware posessing firearms have been illegal for much longer than that.;negative
At least since the Firearms Act 1968 but I imagine their was an act that predated that.;neutral
You're right that there must be other factors.;neutral
It doesn't discount the fact that having guns is one of them.;negative
To me it just seems like a issue of common sense doesnt it?;negative
If you give criminals that want to kill access to guns, they're going to use them.;negative
Is it easier to kill with a gun than without?;neutral
Yes.;neutral
Therefore, more murders.;negative
Can I ask - do you think that if it were legal to posess weaponised anthax, machine guns, rocket launchers, then the rate of murder would also be uneffected?;negative
Common sense?;neutral
If you take away the guns from the people who will become the victims deaths will go up.;neutral
Criminals will still have guns because they don't obey the law.;neutral
So, the law abiding citizens will turn in their guns, and the criminals will keep theirs, and deaths won't go up?;positive
Weaponized anthrax would be impractical to use.;negative
I imagine it would hurt the user as well.;negative
Rocket launchers would be very ineffective as well for a criminal because the only thing you could accomplish would be to kill.;negative
Imagine you are trying to rob someone and you launch a rocket at them, how the heck do you get their wallet now that it is charred remains?;negative
Machine guns would really only help for gang wars, as there is really no reason to be firing multiple shots almost ever.;negative
One bullet or 10 are effective, so the number of bullets fired would likely not affect much.;negative
But death by anthrax, rocket launcher, and machine gun would go up.;negative
Chicago is like the murder capitol of America.;neutral
Thanks a lot gun control.;neutral
"What is the proposed plan to ""fix"" guns in America and how long would it take before it has actually done the job?";neutral
You say having dangerous items around means more death, I say people knowing victims might put up a fight makes it less likely for people to be attacked thus less deaths.;negative
We both have reasons to believe we are right.;neutral
In America suicide accounts for more gun deaths than anything else.;negative
And you say that guns make it easier to kill, so wouldn't it make sense that there would be far more suicides in America?;negative
Is that the case?;neutral
No, England and America have almost identical suicide rates.;neutral
Any explanation for that?;neutral
I am not disputing that we have more people killed.;negative
But, when we look at the UK versus the US in other crimes:;neutral

"""certified firearms instructor"" means nothing, still random guy, with certificate from some random diploma mill.";negative
There's 300 000 000 gun in US so you random number (99.;negative

An an anarchist I do not value a certified person more than a non-certified one in any way whatsoever other than respecting the certified person's luck to have been born to a more privileged family.;negative
Having a qualification or certificate does not mean your from a more priviledged family it just means your worked hard;negative
Say that to the 60 year old man on the verge of death who is only living by the skin of his teeth and worked from the age of 4 in a sweatshop while he looks at the guy with a ton of sports awards and degrees and even a Ph.D who didn't work half as hard as he did.;negative

What about the bloke who grew up in poverty in a Council house but worked hard went to night school worked hard to get his qualifications, or the guy who was born in similar circumstances but worked hard at school got good grades put himself through College and is now a Paramedic.;neutral
Are you kidding me?;negative
This is the real world, that shit is one in a million (if at all).;positive
Its the truth my Dad grew up on a Council Estate in Shepherds Bush his family had hardly a penny to rub together but he worked hard passed his Insurance exams and ran his own business for many years, his neighbour ran one of the biggest tiling firms in the UK, his firm did the tiling in the O2 Arena and Heathrow Airport and a friend of mine at school who grew up on a Council Estate with not a lot of money is the Paramedic I mentioned.;negative
All these Guys did this in the real world and it was all down to their hard work.;negative
Would you admit that all of them, other than the paramedic who I admit is a surprising exception to my rule (since most cultures of poor areas instill values of laziness and lack of hard work on top of lacking facilities to enable it) were LUCKY to have had their businesses bloom (anyone who studies business knows it's always a huge gamble).;negative
I also notice your age and can imagine the era in which your family lived pretty much everyone was poor so it was more fair competition for poor than nowadays.;negative
Of course Luck played its part but it was mainly Hard Work and being self employed businessmen the financial crash in the late 80's caused problems for them both luck runs both ways but we weren't talking about luck we were talking about hard work and your belief that to suceed you had to be born into a wealthy well connected family, I was just proving you wrong.;negative
I guess when my Dad was growing up and started his business there might have been less competition but at the same time there were less chances for a working class lad because the gap between classes was bigger and it was harder to get bank loans to get a business off the ground etc.;negative
My point was more that luck is a far bigger factor in determining the certifications one ends up with than self-initiated factors such as hard work.;negative
Most people cant rely on luck to pass exams they have to work hard, regardless wether its luck or hard work are you now saying that you dont have to be born into a priviledged family to have qualifications/certificates;negative
The quality of teaching, of tutoring, of a quiet household and room to study in, is all luck out of your control.;positive
So now agree it has nothing to do with being born into a family of privelidge;negative
99% to do with that.;neutral
1% are the exception.;neutral

Its got fuck all to do with where your born you can be born into the fanciest family, go to the best schools, private tutors the lot if your lazy your doomed to fail, unless you are one of those very few people who can put the minimum of effort in to get the maximum out, someone from the lowliest of begininngs can pass their exams and get qualified if they work hard enough.;negative
I note your only clinging to your point that my Dad started his Business at a time when the Economic climate was better but have ignored my comments about the Class divide being wider which made it harder to get a business of the ground if you were working class and the fact that he dragged his Business through the economic crash of the late 80's, so your comment about the economic climate of the time is invalid.;negative
Prodigee is right.;positive
.;neutral
What is Prodigee right about?;neutral
Hes changed his stance on this at least twice to start with he was saying the only way you can get qualified is if your born into a family if priviledge then changed his mind to luck is more important to getting qualified than hard work, I think he is wrong in both cases and have given examples.;negative
What do you think he is right about?;neutral
99% I am right, I admit there are phenomenal poeple who are lucky enough to be blessed with a ridiculously high IQ that cancels out the hardship they faced.;negative

Yes, all guns should be banned even if you are certified.;negative
Being certified to use a gun doesn't mean that you aren't going to murder someone.;negative
People do not need to own a gun, not only because of the fact that they are a used to kill people, but also because of all of the accidents that can occur.;negative
Examples like children finding a gun and shooting it.;negative
Having a gun I really a bad idea.;negative
By that logic, so is owning a pair of scissors.;negative
Guns are inanimate objects, they can be used for various purposes and I believe there are times when it is perfectly acceptable and not murder to kill someone (i.e. Self-Defense).;negative
A child finding a gun is not an accident.;negative
It is an act of negligence because most law abiding gun owners keep their guns in a safe to prevent this from happening.;negative
The few spoil it for the majority.;neutral
Gun violence is getting out of hand in America and guns must be banned.;neutral
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
They just aren't as under control as we'd like.;negative
The 81 is probably made up as well;positive
England is notorious for underreporting gun deaths.;negative
I don't see reducing gun deaths as a positive thing.;negative
More people die overall when gun deaths are reduced.;negative
Get real, its not the sort of thing you can cover up.;negative
which helps to explain the USA's rate being much higher;positive
Oh really?;neutral
How about the fact that a triple homicide in England would be reported as one murder thus less gun deaths reported.;neutral
You would like to think so, but the murder rate is higher in the USA in the parts of the country with gun control.;negative
We have implemented gun control in the USA and it does not work, more people die.;negative
Statistics;neutral
Look at the murder rate for England in 1998 after gun regulation was added in 1997;negative
How do you explain that?;neutral
How do you explain that the murder rate is 4 times higher in USA, but only half is because of guns.;neutral
What is your explanation for USA having twice as many non gun deaths?;neutral
I don't agree entirely with this, but automatic and semi automatic weapons should be banned.;negative
Gun don't kill people, people do is a valid statement, but a homicidal person with a semi automatic weapon can kill a whole lot more people before being controlled than if they had a knife.;negative
As for non-automatic weapons, they should require a license.;negative
The beliefm that automatic weapons should be banned holds no more water than any other arguement.;negative
A gun is a gun.;neutral
the mmount of fire it produces makes no difference, and in the hands of an ordinary law abiding citizen a tank, granade launcher or nuclear missile does not pose a threat to anyone becuase he has no intention of using it.;negative
In the hands of a criminal, an ink pen can be rammed into an eye and used to kill someone.;negative
i dont agree, it doesnt matter what kind of gun it was.;negative
IF Auto GUNS DIDNT EXIST... it STILL woulda heppened.....;negative
IF NO GUNS EXISTED AT ALL.....;negative
it still woulda happened......;neutral
same amount of people... same outcome... wich is people dead.;negative
.;neutral
i DO think they would of still killed 20 kids and 6 teachers if that was his intention......;negative
never said anything about slapping either... i said that he would train and train... idc if it took 10 years.....;negative
he wouldve made it a POINT... to make what he wanted to happen... happen.;neutral
.;neutral
he would plan it to the T..;neutral
.;neutral
and make sure that they died.;negative
.;neutral
if thats what he wanted... one way or another.;neutral
.;neutral
without a gun or knife... if thats what he wanted... thats how crazy people work.;negative
i dont agree.....;positive
if those people ( crazy people ) had a sledgehammer ( a gun) i DO NOT think that they would drive the coffin ( kill people) in the ground faster than if they had a regular hammer... ( their own fists and feet ) ......;negative
Because.....;positive
Those people who are crazy enough to do that, are also crazy enough to make SURE it happens.;negative
.;neutral
and put plan, and effort into it... they would learn martial arts, (the kind that can kill people in the blink of an eye ( the same speed as a bullet))... our human body is just as dangerous as a gun... and those crazy ass people would put so much training and planning into their actions that the same result would happen.;negative
( my opinion ( as this is a debate)).;neutral
I'm gonna have to disagree with you there.;negative
No matter how hard a martial artist trained, I don't see how they could be able to kill people as fast as a semi-automatic weapon.;negative
Yes, people would have still been killed, but that many?;neutral
I don't think so.;neutral
"When I say yes to the question ""Should guns be banned in America?""";neutral
, I don't believe that hunting guns would need to be banned.;negative
Yes, they can kill people, but not as fast as a semi-automatic, giving more time for the criminal to be stopped.;negative
I do not see the need for semi-automatic weapons to be purchased by anyone.;negative
When you go hunting, I doubt you assault the deer.;negative
I do agree with you on what you said about how crazy people will go far to make their point, but I still believe that semi-automatics should be banned.;positive
That is just my opinion.;neutral
Semi-automatic guns shoot single rounds....;negative
So we can't have pistols but are allowed to only used 12 gauge pump shotguns or hunting rifles?;negative
Yes, i believe this to be a valid argument.;positive
"I personally support you argument completely; especially the license.";negative
To those who say that guns should be banned completely,;neutral
There are those uses of guns which should be allowed, for example, hunting animals?;negative
yes because some people in America cannot be trusted with one i understand that if its for your protection then yeah go ahead and have one but I'm just saying most crimes happen with handguns.;neutral
"The argument ""no, guns don't kill people"" is ridiculous.";negative
Everyone has seen a shooting movie where someone ends up dead via gun.;negative
The reason people go to war with guns is because they kill people.;negative
yea, but only if you'd kill someone with it.;negative
it's a good decoration item!;positive
i do not think all guns should be banned, but certainly some.;neutral
if your a hunter and you want to kill a deer, then go and by a rifle, but do you really need an AK-47 to kill a little deer?;neutral
and if your buying a gun for protection, then that is just stupid.;negative
there are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for protection.;neutral
get a guard dog, buy an alarm, or move near a place with a lower crime rate.;negative
you could also buy a taser or pepper spray.;negative
First, AK-47s have to be semi automatic to be available for civilian use.;neutral
Second, dogs are good for protection, but mainly intimidation.;neutral
(I have a German Shepherd and a Great Pyrenees so I'm NOT saying dogs aren't good for keeping your house safe).;negative
A bullet in a dog will stop any breed of dog you have, even if it is a 100lb+ dog.;negative
Also, guns are great for protection.;positive
"If you have a shotgun, a robber that just hears you when you cock it will think ""#@$%!""";negative
And if it comes to it, a homeowner will normally pull the trigger in self defense (be sure to get him good in the first shot because only the first shot counts as self defense, all the other shots are assault =D).;negative
Pepper spray and tasers are do not have the stopping power to save you from a criminal.;negative
If s/he is flailing on the ground he can still pull the trigger, and might hit you.;negative
Lastly, what has America come to when you have to move your home because of crime rates?;neutral
If you want to save money, buy a gun and any other form of defense you want.;negative
but most burgerlery's happen when you arn't even home, in which case the gun is mostly likly to be stolen itself.;negative
now a criminal has a gun in his hands;neutral
That depends on the person, an elderly person or computer nerd, or any other stay at home person, will be at home.;neutral
Someone with a very active life might not.;negative
Secondly, most robberies (42%) take place on the streets.;negative
Only 14% of robberies are home invasion, which normally happen between 8:00 PM and 3:00 AM.;negative
Opinions/Guesses aren't facts.;neutral

"People like you are blind when your waiting on your alarm company to alert the police and the three guys who just broke into your home are raping your wife and hurting you family and they just killed your ""guard dog"" what are you going to be doing?";negative

The second amendment wasnt for people to start killing each other, it was for the creation of the militia.;negative
Guns in America, are supposed to keep this world a better place, however, it doesnt do that at all, it only allows criminals to commit crimes.;negative
It definetly doesnt protect anyone from anything, it only harms the people of this country.;negative
And yea, I get that many people save themselves from the criminals that break into their house or try to rape them, but half the time thats not the case.;negative
"""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""";positive
I find is odd all the responses, so far in the debate, have not touched on the main reason, in my mind, why I would never let the law makers take the 2nd amendment away.;negative
It's not for the protection of home invaders, it's not for hunting and it's not even for attacks on the street, it's for protection from the powers to be.;negative
I believe the MAIN reason we should all support the 2nd amendment is to keep the power of gun ownership in our hands and not in the hands of the government.;negative
If all American citizens loose their right to gun ownership the only ones left with the guns are the police....;neutral
and this is a scary thought.;neutral
REALLY?!;neutral
That's interesting.;positive
Riddle me this: How would one STOP a criminal with a gun who is committing a crime?;negative
You're joking, right?;neutral
You don't think peoples lives have been saved because they carry a firearm?;neutral
Why do you think people choose to carry guns in the first place?;negative
Because they want to shoot someone?;neutral
Let's look at BIG PICTURE, for a moment: GUNS protected the LIFE and LIBERTY and FREEDOM that you now take for granted in this country.;negative
this is why we ban guns isn't it?;negative
They would shoot the criminal so they can protect themselves, their money, their family, or a friend.;negative
Guns are illegally imported from South America every day.;neutral
Criminals are already breaking the law, what would they care if they just broke one more law?;negative
By the way, guns end wars.;neutral
The common counter-argument is:;neutral
If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns.;negative
precisely what we are proposing, the fact that all guns will be illegal (aside from certain licenced people) will mean that guns arent allowed and no one has gunsmeaning that the only people with the guns are outlaws and can be dealt with through law;negative
Except that they haven't, can't, and won't be dealt with by the law.;negative
The same reason why banning alcohol during prohibition didn't prevent people from consuming alcohol, and the same reason why the current Drug War doesn't prevent people from doing drugs.;negative
Prohibition doesn't work!;negative
Even if we wanted to ban firearms, we have a CONSTITUTIONAL guarantee.;negative
The only difference this would do is to disarm law abiding citizens and to strip them of their constitutional rights.;negative
that is a rediculous arguement, thats like saying, people still murder we may as well make it legal.;negative
and this is something i dont understand about you americans, why do you want guns so much?;positive
the only thing they are there for is to kill and harm others, the fact that you have some flimsy piece of paper saying you are allowed them doesnt make it right that you should.;negative
i dont see a single valid reason why you should have a gun and yet there are plenty of reasons that you shouldnt have them.;positive
as far as i am concerned you did not present one valid arguement there.;neutral
the war on drugs we have to fight just like we fight the war on terrorism, it may not be sucessful but its far better than the alternative.;negative
the exact same is applied here;neutral
"On the contrary, it's your spelling that is ""rediculous"".";negative
"There is no such thing as a ""safe"" murder, murder inevitably always violates someone's rights.";negative
"There is such a thing as ""safe"" Gun ownership which itself violates nobody's rights, your comparison is nonsense.";negative
Because it is our Constitutional Right.;positive
Because they allowed us to earn our independence?;negative
Because we have a long and storied hunting culture.;neutral
Well you're ignoring the fact that Guns are also used for sport shooting, and hunting.;negative
Not to mention the very fact that someone posses a firearm is often enough to scare off a would-be criminal.;negative
If this isn't enough guns have in instances been used to defend one's family against home intruders.;negative
They are also a safeguard against tyranny.;negative
If criminals aren't following the current gun regulations that we already have, what makes you think they are going to follow a prohibition on firearms?;negative
Remember the United States is not an island, we will always have easy access to firearms whether they are legal or illegal.;negative
This 'flimsy' piece of paper guarantees our rights as citizens, it protects us from our own government and it protects us from foreign governments.;negative
It has been the inspiration for other constitutions around the world.;negative
It extrapolates the views that unite Americans as a people, and has been instrumental in our rise to dominance as a world power.;negative
It is the bedrock of my nation and it ensures my liberty.;positive
"It may not mean a lot to you, but I defend this ""flimsy"" piece of paper with my very life, not the paper itself but the ideas and principals that it represents.";negative
If you don't understand this, you will never have an understanding that transcends your little cultural bubble.;negative
I just listed a bunch of reasons:;neutral
-We have a Constitutional Guarantee;negative
-Recreational Hunting;neutral
-Sport shooting;neutral
-Deters would-be criminals;neutral
-Safeguard against tyranny;neutral
-Protect home;neutral
To say you didn't see a single reason is to say your eyes were closed.;negative
You cannot win a debate with denial.;negative
Part of the fear of firearms is with negative cultural associations, particularly with gun crime, but firearms along with just about anything else can be misused, this is not in itself justification to ban or prohibit ownership of such possessions.;negative
Knives are used almost as often if not more so in crimes than are guns, the reason nobody is pushing to ban knives is because knives don't have the same negative cultural association guns have.;negative
Please give me the reasons you think we shouldn't be allowed to own firearms.;negative
I think we should attempt to help drug addicts, but punishing people for an addiction is pure insanity.;positive
People are getting locked up even for harmless drugs like Marijuana and yet many more dangerous drugs, more addictive drugs, are completely legal such as prescription drugs.;negative
The Drug War, is complete BS, just like your argument.;negative
You shout the criminal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;neutral
Thats why we have them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;neutral
really... stopping guns is not that easy.;negative
with alcohol, when it was banned people could sell it at unreasonable prices.;negative
that is how Al Capone got rich.;positive
"so people would still use guns ""under the table"".";neutral
who do you think would be the new Al Capone.;neutral
criminals rob banks, robbing banks is illegal, so if you add them up you get that criminals would not stop using guns because it is the law.;negative
uoknow= EPIC FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;neutral
even if guns were banned they would still be sold illegally but the hundreds of children dieing because they think its a toy wouldn't be here anymore if the police and the military kept their guns the criminals with the illegal guns would have a much lower gun supply.;neutral
I am not American and in Europe you need a license to buy guns which already by far lowers the crime rate.;negative
America or the world with out guns would be a better place with less shootings, by far.;negative
Guns only protect from other guns and create firefights the military and police may need them but for what does anyone else need them?;negative
the police can protect you with no guns you aren't a threat to criminals and they wont have guns.;negative
I rest my case;neutral
the police and military arnt your personal body gaurds.lets say 6 gangbangers jump you.;neutral
then what?;neutral
in europe you dont have illegall imagrants jumpin the border and robbing places.;negative
and forming gangs.;neutral
You are right you are not an American so how bout this keep your uneducated baseless opinion in europe.;neutral
Thanks;neutral
I agree exactly what I would say;neutral
Some people can be idiots with guns;negative
The second amendment was created for the following reasons: deterring undemocratic government, repelling invasion, suppressing insurrection, facilitating the natural right of self defense, participating in law enforcement and slave control in slave states (no longer applicable).;negative
So the second amendment is in place so people can kill other people under certain circumstances, that is of course what guns are for in the first place.;negative
Theres good reason why 12 year olds can't vote, or for that matter own guns.;negative
Regardless of whether or not you think guns cause more harm than good, this is not the issue.;negative
We have a constitutional guarantee, a right to bear arms.;positive
We cannot simply disregard the constitution when we don't like what it says.;negative
The right to bear arms, is a check on the government.;positive
It was set in place to ensure that if the government oversteps it's boundaries that the collective will of the people, could if necessary revolt and start from scratch.;negative
It is meant as a last resort against tyranny.;neutral
Do you really think that if the government were to try and take over, that your 22 in your gunsafe is going to hold off trained soldiers with automatic rifles?;negative
In today's society there is no reason for guns.;negative
The right to bear arms was fine when everyone had the same revolver or single-round chambered rifle, but things have changed a bit since then.;positive
Firstly, I am a trained soldier.;negative
And most soldiers never move their weapon's selector off semi.;negative
"Secondly, Many civilians own rifles; my brother owns an AR-15 (legally).";negative
Many Hunters practically own an arsenal.;neutral
"There are many civilian based ""Militias"" around the country.";neutral
Many military grade weapons are actually legal to own.;neutral
Certain miniguns are legal to own in many states, due to the sheer impracticality of committing a crime with them (due to their size).;negative
Not to mention the number of weapons owned illegally.;negative
Thirdly, if there was such an event where the civilian populace felt it needed to overthrow the government, I'm fairly confident many military members would resign or defect to join that cause.;negative
Finally, there are 300 million Americans and enough guns to arm everyman woman and child 3 times over, if the civilian population was determined enough, no military force on earth could stop them.;negative
Determination is everything in war.;neutral
Remember we lost the Vietnam war because we did not have the will to take the war to it's full conclusion, and we won the Revolutionary war against a superior force because we had the will and determination to fight it until the very end.;positive
Ok let me say something and don't take offense for voicing my opinion.;negative
The very idea to ban a constitutionally gurranteed right is unconstitutional.;negative
I am sure that you live in a large city such as New York or Chicago and work in a cubicle everyday isulated from all of the real threats the outside world presents.;negative
I can assure you that if some one broke into your house tonight and shot your family your opinions about the right to own guns would change.;negative
You would go out and buy a pistol and be waitinag for the chance to use it.;negative
I live in North Carolina and this debate is close to my heart.;positive
I have seen first hand what happens when whistle blowers like you get involved and screw things up for our country.;neutral
Our country was based on the fact that a man could buy a gun and live out in the middle of no where and provide for himself.;negative
Firearms do not kill people, the person pulling the triggger does that.;negative
The presence of a gun for protection or even for recreation should never be challanged and if you have a problem with guns in Theis country go somewhere else.;negative
Thank you;neutral
Imagine a society in which only the police and higher authoritites have guns.;negative
People are greedy and will overstep their privilages.;negative
Even though polices officer's duty is to help, their are cops who break the law.;neutral
And what can we do if they're the only ones who have guns?;neutral
Nothing.;neutral
Also, if the government tried taking over there would be more then just one person to stop.;negative
Militia would form and revolt.;negative
If guns were banned it would do nothing to stop crime.;negative
A good example of this is marijuana.;positive
Yea, its illegal says the Federal Government, but just about anybody who wants to smoke pot does.;negative
People will get a hold of guns one way or another so why bann them and waste time and effort getting rid of them.;negative
ha ha ha ha ha Thanks for the great laugh.;positive
Our second amendment was given to us so we THE PEOPLE can uprise against the government if needed.;negative
the criminals will always be there to break the law and will find guns illegally.;positive
If you have your home broken into and you have no gun then you better hope you can run faster then the bullet they will have following you.;negative
None of you understand, stopping the selling of guns won't stop criminals.;negative
It will allow them to get away with MORE.;neutral
You people fail to realize if someone is intent on committing a crime they will most likely GET A GUN, stopping the selling of guns will just restrict civilians from protecting themselves.;negative
If someone wants a gun for a bad purpose... they MOST likely WILL get one Illegally and it probably wont be as hard as most of you seem to think.;negative
Gun ban = No civilians can protect themselves using a firearm = Criminals can illegally purchase guns, like tons already do.;negative
You people are stupid;negative
I agree with Urstupid , no matter what .;negative
.;neutral
Stupid people will still buy guns illegally .;negative
They will find a way , and im not giving up my guns for nobody .;neutral
i bought and payed for them the legal way .;neutral
and if someone came in my home and tryed to rob or kill me I WILL have a gun to protect myself.;negative
That just proves that only people who own guns go against making it illegal.;negative
The idea for banning guns is to make it more harder to get it, which is true.;negative
It will be more harder to get access with a gun, and therefore less people are shot.;negative
Read the CONSTITUTION, or founders knew you long before you were born.;negative
They protect you from yourself.;positive
That is utterly false.;negative
Guns in people's homes have prevented them from being victims of violent attacks in countless thousands of cases, and your militia you refer to was composed of regular urban men, not military men and they were armed.;negative
Seriously, you want everyone to believe that the right to keep a gun by your bed does not help keep a person able to grab it in the face of a violent attack and fight back?;negative
"Do you really believe that the ""police"" would ever be able to respond quick enough if they could even be called?";neutral
Or do the lives of people who dont have homes with alarms and steel doors matter?;neutral
Tell you what, the day you are faced with a violent attack and get to experience this first hand, we'll see what you have to say then!;positive
What about the other half?;neutral
Would you want your family in that half?;neutral
Think about that.;neutral
Yes of course!!;neutral
Guns might hurt people or even kill people!The point is:u cannot control the ones actually have guns!They will hurt people when they want!!;negative
They will use their guns!!;neutral
If u don't ban it,what is the use of police??;negative
They trained to be strong and catch the thieves...Now,all Americans got guns.;positive
.;neutral
Even police cannot stop them from stealing.;negative
.;neutral
(because they got guns either)...So how can we let the Americans hurt people by using guns again and again?;negative
This is a very flawed point of view.;negative
For one, guns are meant for self defense and to fight wars.;neutral
Even if we did ban guns people will still get them, how do you think people get weed?;neutral
Keeping guns legal would keep the black market activity down and with people without guns it would be so easy to rob someone's house.;negative
Besides you can't carry a cop around with you now can you?;negative
everybody is talking about how the government is going to take over, and guns will be the only way to protect ourselves.;positive
it sounds like some bad movie premise.;negative
how has the government taken over exactly, and what is so bad if it did?;negative
i mean isn't a nation supposed to be run by a government?;negative
if we were under the control of a tyrant, then i could understand, but we live in a democracy.;neutral
we choose our leaders, and can impeach them if we do not like them.;negative
it is not a perfect system i know, but it ensures that no person can take control of our country.;neutral
even if somebody did, then do you really think a gun is going to be you saving grace?;negative
if there was a so called tyrant, then he probably has taken over the militia, and do you think that you would win against a trained solider who probably has better weapons.;negative
We are not a democracy, we are a republic.;negative
In case of a military coup', or a bad president somehow holding on to power, we need guns.;negative
The US Armed Forces has 1.5 million personnel.;negative
The population is about 350 million.;neutral
Currently 21.6% of Americans own a firearm.;negative
Thats 1.5 million v.s. 60 million.;neutral
And we have all economic powers on our side.;negative
Its hands down, BP and other gas stations have the gas the military needs, and we also have the food they need.;negative
We might even be one of the few countries left who's citizens could defeat the military.;negative
Also, I just realized this, but in the event of WWIII, we could have 60+ million soldiers.;negative
Along with the 44% of the world's military budget, we could easily conquer the world.;positive
http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_percentage_of_Americans_own_guns;neutral
First of all if you dont think we ae run by tyrants, you dont watch the news.;negative
Second off, when was the last time we had a leader who inflicted terrible damage on the country, as Obama has, and gotten them impeached?;negative
Your arguement is entirely false, and on top of it, I am not worried about using guns to stop some government filled with corrupt leaders.;negative
I enjoy target shooting, I enjoy owning antique guns, and I fel a hell of a lot safer knowing that if I am attacked, I will not be empty handed and helpless.;positive
End of story.;neutral
"And Virginia Tech was not an ""incident,"" it was a massacre.";negative
If all the students had also had guns then there is no way that asshole could have killed as many innocent people as he did.;negative
My condolensces to the families of the victims.;neutral
If all the students also had guns, there'd be massacres on a regular basis.;negative
Guns don't kill people, people do, but people with plastic butter knives kill far fewer people than people with guns.;negative
If someone believes that students with guns would lead to regular massacres, then they obviously have one terrible school system or are afraid of some rotten kids.;negative
Aside from that lame arguement, no one is suggesting arming students, we have long suggested that instructors and officials in schools who want to be armed should be, unless of course you are going to argue that principals will go on shooting rampages.;negative
Ever hear of that?;neutral
gun's are baaaaaad crack.;neutral
they should so be banned, too many young people can access them too easily!;negative
BAN NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!;neutral
both guns and knives kill people, but guns are way more effective at doing so, that's why we send soilders over seas with guns and not knives, and that is why guns should be banned because they are too effective as weapons;negative
Guns being effective is a good thing.;positive
If I was a 40 year old man with a wife and kid, and someone barged into my house trying to rob/harm us, I would shoot him.;negative
Also, guns being effective is great for hunting, I've seen people try to hunt with bows, it's insanely hard.;positive
You are right on the money.;positive
first we banned drugs, and that lead to a drug free country.;neutral
Then we forbade drunk driving and that put an end to drunk driving accidents.;neutral
If we just had the sense to ban murder and rape, robbery, carjacking, along with guns........hey wait a minute....;negative
all guns are used for is killing, they are weapons.;negative
that is why we should outlaw them, because all they are made to do is kill.;negative
sure you can kill with other things, but most homicide weapons are guns.;negative
guns are made to kill, if not then can you tell me how they can be used without shooting at somthing?;neutral
Guns should be banned because although most of the time they don't do anybody real harm the police pose a threat and if they miss they could hit anyone.;negative
Surely, even if somebody has robbed a sweet shop or something similar to that they should not be shot.;negative
That is a unnecessary.;negative
lets say a cop pulls someone over with a trunk full of dope and they have an illegally bought gun.;neutral
then what?;neutral
ask him to stop?;neutral
no police need guns to keep the piece.;neutral
I believe that there is a reason the police are trained with a knowledge of martial arts and there is also a reason why they have bullet proof vests and all of that.;negative
What I do not understand is why the winning argument for this is 'no, guns don't kill people', when clearly they are a weapon used for harming or killing.;negative
There is no way a sane person can honestly say guns are good and the fact they exist is a great way to improve our planet!';positive
Guns are bad, they kill.;negative
However I realise that if there were a serious offence and someone attacked the police with a gun things could turn bad quickly.;neutral
Which is why I have tagged this as 'Keep the Guns, Change the System'.;negative
Perhaps they should change the law and copy the English where the police have guns in serious conditions but usually they leave them alone.;negative
Any arguments?;neutral
Any arguments?;neutral
Every year 30,000 people die of gun shots in America, and still there are many states that don’t keep guns illegal.;negative
"There are people who are afraid to get shot when they travel there; this is a sad fact.";negative
I argue that guns should be illegal for many reasons.;neutral
"First of all, guns give a better chance for criminals to commit crimes; knowing that with knives they don’t stand a chance.";negative
Second, there is a greater percentage, by data, that people are more harmed with guns rather than protected.;positive
Gunshot incidents in school make it all the more clearer that kids can unintentionally shoot.;negative
Finally, if guns are illegal than it will be harder to get buy a gun and therefore less people will be murdered.;neutral
Sure, if guns were banned it would be hard to get them, kind of like it is hard to get a joint, hard to get cocaine, hard to get crack......bull!;negative
There are two things that make a gun dangerous, a stupid person or an evil one.;negative
The rest of us own guns, work and live around people who dont know we have them and we do just fine.;positive
For all you know you've been around fifty people today who had a piece on them and you are alive right now because non of them were criminals.;positive
One criminal, and gun or not, you'd be in deep doo doo.;negative
You want to know why it's so easy to get drugs?;negative
Because people get addicted and need the high, and there is good business behind it, not to mention the ingredients for weed and cocaine grow in the ground, so there is an unlimited supply.;positive
I completely agree that guns are dangerous in the hands of an evil or stupid person, but there are also countless accounts of accidental shootings.;negative
Point being, guns are meant to hurt and harm, regardless of who owns them and for what reason.;neutral
I understand that banning guns will not stop criminals from accessing them, but it will surely drop the crime rate and make it much harder to get a gun.;negative
Imagine trying to fend off someone who is pointing a gun at you rather than a knife, which situation do you think you'd have a better chance of surviving?;negative
Well then wouldn’t the best solution be to educate people rather than punish everyone?;negative
Yes but if the principles or any of the teachers of school shootings that have happened over the years the principles/teachers would have been able to shoot the man and might have even stopped the man from even shooting anyone.;negative
Switzerland has a gun death rate of 6 in 100,00.;negative
America has a gun death rate of just over 10 in 100,000.;neutral
England outlawed all handguns and has a 0.6 per 100,000 gun death rate.;negative
[1] The facts are pretty clear that in countries where guns are allowed, more people are shot and killed.;neutral
In 1999, there were 28,874 gun-related deaths in the United States - over 80 deaths every day.;negative
In 1999, 58% of all gun deaths were suicides, and 38% were homicides.;negative
Of all suicides, 57% occurred by firearm.;negative
In 2000, 75,685 people (27/100,000) suffered non-fatal firearm gunshot injuries.;negative
What, exactly, is the point of guns?;neutral
The fact of the matter is that America has a culture where guns are OK, and the only thing that is ever going to do is mean a great increase in gun crime.;negative
Guns are pointless in this day and age.;negative
Yes we need to ban guns.;neutral
And while we are at it we need to ban cars because in drunk driving accidents they kill people.;neutral
While we are at it we need to ban murder, rape robbery incest child battery wife battery dead batteries school shooting, drugs family violence, ....oh wait, those things have been banned for centuries.;negative
Well then they must not exist......wait a minute, whats wrong with this picture??;negative
Guns can have other uses, such as hunting.;negative
Also banning guns won't stop criminals getting guns.;negative
Guns can be smuggled to criminals illegally.;neutral
if you shoot people they can die or get hurt very badly.why should people do that and this is why guns should be banned from america;negative
Guns should be far more restricted than they are now.;negative
We have far higher murder rates than almost any other first-world country.;negative
Yes, it's important to protect 2nd amendment rights.;negative
But they should not be unrestricted.;negative
In Arizona, the Republican led state legislature has become enamored with a law allowing concealed weapons on every university campus in the state - the schools cannot ban them.;negative
What's worse, they originally wanted to extend that to the public school system!;negative
I have a number of friends who are good, honorable gun owners.;positive
I know they are very responsible with their weapons.;negative
I also have a friend who is border-line mentally disabled, and was given a concealed weapons permit.;negative
Once, I took him to the local convenience store to buy him a Coke.;neutral
When we returned, there was a guy walking toward the house, with the intention of stealing his bike.;negative
"""Oh no!";negative
"I've got my .45 there!""";neutral
This nitwit left a loaded .45 in a bike bag, and parked the bike in the driveway unlocked - instead of leaving it inside the fenced yard, which was guarded by a Rottweiler and a German Shepard!;negative
Never mind the fact that had he said something, of course he could have put the freaking thing in the locked house!;negative
He's a security guard, and a few months later he decided to take the gun to work.;positive
Never mind that he's only licensed as an unarmed guard.;negative
It's against the law for him to have a gun with him.;neutral
Never mind that the company he worked for didn't have a license for him to have it, either.;negative
So what does he do?;neutral
Of course!;neutral
He left the same loaded .45 in his LUNCH BOX, unguarded on his desk at work, where it was stolen!;negative
I have two huge problems with both these situations:;neutral
1.;neutral
I completely object to being forcibly made part of a gun battle between someone like this and a shooter.;negative
I know this guy, and he's more likely to have the gun taken from him and used against him or someone like me, than he ever would be to defend anyone.;negative
2.;neutral
People like this unwittingly supply the black market to street thugs at discount prices no less.;neutral
His right to a gun has to be weighed against my right to be secured from his negligence.;positive
Don't involve me in a fantasy some people seem to have that this is the wild west and every theater and fast food place is the OK Corral.;negative
Responsible gun ownership, please?!;positive
Well if you would like more gun restriction why not just move to Chicago where they are basically banned.;negative
First of all, you do not have a right to safety, if your friend was acting in a negligent manner with his firearm and breaking the law then he shall be prosecuted.;negative
To demand that other people forfeit their rights as guaranteed by the constitution so you can gain a false illusion of safety and security is absurd, although sadly this is the view of many today.;negative
Just about every downfall of a free nation to a totalitarian one begins with irrational fear, then the removal of human rights in the name of public safety.;negative
"In regard to your ""problems"".";neutral
1.;neutral
Whether or not you object to being in an unsafe situation is irrelevant, you are responsible for your own safety in the end.;negative
Don't like it?;negative
Too bad, as I said being safe is not a right, it's your responsibility.;negative
Easy solution, don't hang out with that guy.;negative
2.;neutral
People like this do not supply the black market in significant numbers, as most gun owners are not this irresponsible, although a lot of illegal guns are stolen and straw purchases.;negative
But nonetheless, it really makes no difference where they come from because as long as there is a demand, there will be a supply, if they can no longer steal guns, they will illegally import them, if they can no longer import them they will fabricate them themselves.;negative
Don't think that is possible, then you are very ignorant of reality because they can fabricate fully automatic assault rifles in third world countries with primitive tools and skills, and I have even seen cases of people making a .22 handgun in a state prison.;negative
This argument is so exhausted there's no other word for it than stupid.;negative
And it's not just guns, it's the prohibition of anything.;negative
This country has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that banning any type of item does not work, and in fact only makes the problem significantly worse.;negative
It has not worked with alcohol, the war on drugs is an even more impressive failure and waste of money, it has not worked with the current restrictions on firearms, and will not work with any further ones.;negative
If gun restrictions worked in this country, Chicago and DC would be the safest places in America, in which they are not, and Vermont and New Hampshire would be the most dangerous.;negative
The police will do an excellent job at investigating the murder of you or your loved one but they will NOT protect you from it happening.;positive
Those that are so against gun ownership and concealed carry have never been the direct victim of a violent crime.;negative
The police are handcuffed by liberal laws which deny them the ability to properly do their job.;negative
These days, criminals have more rights than law-abiding citizens.;negative
Blame your society, not the police.;neutral
The threat of death must be held over the head of every criminal who seeks to kill by arms.;negative
Ever wonder why there was no crime in the former Soviet Union?;negative
There is some wackos out there, to me YOU are one of them as well, and YOU dont need a gun.;negative
But I would never stand in the way of every perfect mental sane person owning a bazoka, machine gun or any other type weapon.;negative
I am a COP and 21 years Military, WHO ARE YOU JOKER>;negative
Take my rights away because you hang around the mentals.;neutral
Most objects have the potential to be a threat.;neutral
A knife sitting on a kitchen table may be harmless but in the hands of a thief it can be deadly.;negative
Guns have more potential to be dangerous than knives but simply being dangerous is not grounds for banning an object.;negative
What?!;neutral
Of course it should!;neutral
Under that logic, all drugs should be legal.;negative
Surely you can see a problem with that.;neutral
That is why we have a license for certain guns....;negative
You drive a car knowing the risks and that you can die from driving them, people still drive them anyways.;negative
No.;neutral
There is a difference between 'dangerous' and a 'threat'.;positive
A car is dangerous because it can run you over but it is not a threat.;negative
It can be a threat if it's driven by a mad man.;neutral
Drugs are not 'dangerous' just sitting on a table with no-one to consume them.;negative
They become a threat when they are handed out to kids on the street.;neutral
You my friend are and idiot.;neutral
If I hand a gun to a mentally fit person who knows how to handle the gun then they shall be fine and will not kill someone.;neutral
Hand the same gun to a person who has a mental issue and also can handle that gun you have a murder on your hands.;negative
Banning the gun will not help the unstable person they will use some other weapon to commit the crimes their brain tells them to.;negative
Help the unstable person and then no murder.;neutral
Well you guys have answered the question already danielcraig and ta9798.;neutral
A totally sensible approach with the only, somewhat irrational argument for retaining your weapons to defend against the Government!;negative
Sorry THEDert, but hardly likely or relevant, at least we hope!;negative
Lets face it, history dictates we are hardly a nice race are we?;negative
"We use any excuse to batter the living daylights out of each other; race, religion, fun, etc.";positive
To think how much more advanced we'd be if we didn't constantly flatten everything we've spent time and money building and spent those resources on developing our society.;negative
But hey, it'll never happen.;negative
It's a sad world we live in where certain life forms find it necessary to fly planes into buildings.;neutral
Disarming the terminally insane would be a good start, but who's to judge who're the insane?!;negative
Guns should be banned everywhere.;neutral
That provides no logical defense for your side.;neutral
guns aren't needed on the daily by people outside of the armed forces so i really don't see a need for us carrying guns.;negative
it only leads to violence and gangbanging anyways...;neutral
besides, i remember reading once that in the countries that had banned guns and an over 90% less deaths to weaponry than in the u.s. now THAT says something.;negative
Banning guns wouldn't bring down gun violence significantly because people who are committing gun crimes are getting their guns illegally in the first place.;negative
And other countries that have banned guns have alot more variables to consider besides just banning guns alone.;negative
most other countries have a much tighter justice system that doesn't give any wiggle room for crimes in general let alone gun crimes.;negative
Democrats all the way son!!!;neutral
Obama Obama Obama... Republicans are bums;negative
if a robber came in your house you would want a gun.;neutral
Actually, no I wouldn't.;negative
"If a robber came into my house in an area where gun ownership is legal, I'd have to seriously consider whether or not this person is also going to have a gun; why would they enter my house unarmed if they knew that chances were that I would have a gun?";negative
All this is going to do is cause a shootout, with most likely someone (50% chance it's me) getting shot.;negative
I'd rather hand over my stuff (it's just stuff), claim on the insurance afterwards and have a greatly reduced risk of ending up dead.;negative
So let me get this straight... Home invasions almost always means that they are just there for your stuff, that means that they are not going to rape your wife and daughter in front of you while you're tied to a chair then kill all 3 of you after they get their kicks then take your stuff?;negative
Uh, who's going to collect the insurance?;neutral
Probably whoever is not at home durring that time I guess, or some other family members currently not living there right?;negative
Actually, yes.;neutral
Thousands of burglaries happen every day, and I'm sure in a lot of cases they happen when people are at home.;negative
There are not, however, thousands of the scenario you described.;negative
So, yes, home invasion almost always means that they are there for your stuff.;negative
If they were to burgle my house, then me.;negative
I'd buy some nice shiny new shit, and enjoy it knowing that I didn't get shot in the face because I tried to be a hero.;positive
That's your opinion and I respect that, but, there still is a chance of a rapist invading your home.;negative
If you fall down the stairs, maybe one in a thousand times you will break your neck.;negative
I know that is a small chance, but the consequences for that small chance are drastic.;negative
"Also, just shouting ""I have a gun!""";positive
at a robber, will scare them away.;negative
Especially if they can't see you, you speak in as low a voice as possible, and with as much confidence as you can muster.;neutral
Then, cocking your weapon wil double the effect.;neutral
In 1995, an 85 year old man's house was robbed, he shot and killed the robber.;negative
Later, the police confiscated his weapon.;negative
Three days after that, another robber came into his house, the 85 year old man's body was found strangle in his room.;negative
Neighbors say he would have been OK if he had had his .22 rifle.;neutral
They also said he was commonly robbed, when people would see him working in his backyard.;negative
If someone breaks into a home the homeowner almost always has the advantage.;negative
They know the layout of their house better than whoever is breaking in.;negative
when it comes to real-life applications the chances of you geting shot are way less than 50-50.;neutral
Look it up;neutral
Yeah and we all know how fast insurance money comes in right?;negative
Id er have to disagree with you on that.;negative
What if they steal some of youre valuable stuff, like computers, and flat screens.;neutral
what if insurance companies dont cover that.;neutral
Oh right, youre next idea is probably to put this under guvernment control, as if the government dosn't control enough of our daily lives.;negative
At any rate, If someone broke into my home (how would they have gotten those guns with all the restrictions may you ask?;negative
Simple, they would have stolen them illegally), I would defend my hard earned stuff.;negative
Im not willing to risk it after working so hard to earn the stuff, only to have it stolen.;negative
And what if the intruder's aim is to kill me?;neutral
Am I supposed to just let him?;neutral
Maybe you people wouldnt mind, but I would.;neutral
Im not about to lay down my life for some random creep.;neutral
I would prefer to live, personal preference you know?;neutral
The only way to defend myself is to bear arms myself.;negative
excactly.;neutral
so protect yourself dumbass.;negative
if i was going top rob a house in an area guns were legal or not i would have a gun.because guese what if im breaking the law anyway might as well be a pro at it.;neutral
Well being in an area where gun ownership is illegal is not going to have any thing to do with the criminal having a gun.;negative
They will have a gun anyway.;neutral
Breaking and entering is illegal so do you think that are going to worry about carrying a gun also.;negative
The insurance part I totally understand cause I have a lot of stuff in my house and have it all insured and I can replace them.;positive
I have 12 GA Shotgun loaded with 00 Buck for home protection.;negative
Now when I'm not here the insurance takes over, the gun is only to protect my family.;negative
You'd rather hand over your stuff and write it off etc..;negative
what about when they want you wife and daughter to do what they want.;neutral
"Not a cold day is $&ELL;that's going to happen to me.";negative
Think about it.;neutral
You don't have to kill someone just cause you have a gun.;negative
You have the option to if needed.;neutral
I don't mean to be a ass, but that is one of the dumbest answers ever.;positive
First off it would not matter if guns were illegal in your state or not, if a criminal wants to get a gun they will get one somehow.;neutral
second off if they knew you were armed i seriously think they would reconsider entering your home.;neutral
and the third thing is that if they know you are home chances are they are there to do more harm than just steal your crap.;negative
learn how to use a gun, be responsible, protect yourself and your family.;negative
In the neighbor counties around me there have been three different murders, and they think it is the same people, they are targeting people that are home tying them up and killing them.;negative
would you not feel at least a little better knowing you could possibly defend yourself ?;negative
No offense but I've been threw this and u have no idea what ur talking about I would rather get in a shoot out than have my wife or kid raped and killed u have no idea about what happens in a situation like this u think that they just want money;negative
What if the intruder did not come in for your things?;neutral
Would you be able to protect your family?;neutral
yup yup your wrong there bum.;negative
People need weapons to protect their liquor stores from being robbed by your people bum.;negative
U.S. is supposed to be in caps you uneducated bum.;negative
I buy your people bum.;negative
What about hunting?;neutral
Anyway, guns are illegally imported everyday.;neutral
If there was a gang that was coming into my house, trying to rob me, I would want my gun to kill them.;negative
That's not true.;negative
If it is, then show me a link.;negative
In a Australia they band guns, and guess what?;neutral
Crime went up drastically.;negative
Bad guys are always going to have weapons, it's just a fact.;negative
So, shouldn't me or you have the right to protect ourselves?;negative
actually austrailia has one of the lowest gun mortality rates in the whole world;neutral
I never said they had a high gun mortality rate, but they have a high crime rate (compared to before the gun band.);neutral
Yes, because 'gang-bangers' got their guns from legal sources to begin with?;negative
Banning guns will stop gun violence, like the prohibition stopped people from drinking.;negative
All this would do is create a greater demand for an illegal gun trade.;positive
And again, I must reiterate, that we still have a Constitutional Guarantee to own guns.;negative
Guns are need by people outside of the armed forces.;neutral
If the government told us to turn our guns in it would lead to more violence.;neutral
Criminals who do not follow the laws will keep their guns or get them illegally.;negative
In Australia, the government banned weapons in 1996, after a publicized shooting.;negative
Immediately after the ban, armed robberies rose by 73 percent, unarmed robberies by 28 percent, kidnappings by 38 percent, assaults by 17 percent, and manslaughter by 29 percent.;negative
The United Kingdom had similar results.;neutral
We have the right to bear arms and to protect our life and freedom even if you think we don't.;positive
Man were are u from I use a gun just to go buy my grocerys have u ever even been in a life or death situation if it happens then come tell me u don't want a gun if ur alive;negative
First of all, crime happens on a daily basis, and while auto insurance is not needed on a daily basis, we have it dont we?;negative
Second, having a gun does not lead to violence and gang banging, having a mentality that seeks to force your will on another DOES lead to gang banging and crime.;neutral
I have had guns my entire life and never had one ounce of desire to harm another.;neutral
And if you actually think countries that have banned guns have less crime, try living in one.;negative
New York and Washington DC are hotbeds of violence and murder and they dont like regular folks to own guns.;negative
I will also prove my point to you: Where have you heard of nationally famous shootings?;negative
Columbine and Virginny Tech as well as Ohio.;neutral
"Guess what, they were ""gun free zones"" and idiots demanded gun bans when bans had failed.";negative
Where have you never ever heard of a gun rampage?;neutral
Gun shows.;neutral
That says something.;neutral
Absolutely they should be banned.;neutral
There are almost no cases where an innocent person has defended themselves with a gun.;negative
And sure guns don't kill people, but the death rate would definately go down if people did not have easy access to weapons.;negative
I mean look at the VT incident.;neutral
A college kid, with a clearly bad background record, managed to buy guns and ammo.;negative
We outlaw gun's and stuff like that does not happen;negative
Wrong!;neutral
Last year 2.5 million people were saved by using a gun for self defense.;negative
"I don't consider that ""almost no cases where an innocent person has defended themselves.""";negative
i can prove that here:;neutral
http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1071444;neutral
Oh and i used you in my Bibliography for my essay!;positive
i dont even see it could come across the mind of any intelligent person that people who are innocent dont use guns to defend themselves, thats like saying if someone broke into your house to rob you and they didnt know you were there that they wouldnt want to kill you therefore having a gun could protect you from a scared criminal.;negative
probama it would still happen you F*ing moron if they arent afraid of going to prison for killing people they definately wouldnt be afraid to get a gun illegaly.;negative
I also used you.;positive

Guns are illegal in Chicago.;neutral
How do you explain Chicago having the highest homicide rate?;neutral
Don't worry... I'll wait.;neutral
Where'd you read that?;neutral
The NRA Newsletter?;neutral
Highest gun related death per capita: DC, where guns are legal link;negative
Lowest gun related death per capita: Hawaii, where guns are illegal link;negative
And see Xaeon's arguement below.;negative
Chicago is like 15 on the list.;neutral
link And considering the poverty rate, and that it's the 3rd largest city (and probably the second most dense) that's actually not bad.;negative
"I find your argument inadequate, circumstantial and irrelevant, comparing overall homicide rates to ""gun related"" deaths.";negative
Chicago is 15 on the list because it's sorted alphabetically... :/;negative
BTW, Hawaii's figures rival those of Chicago according to that same list.;negative
Of course the lowest gun related deaths will be in the the states where guns are banned, duh.;negative
Lowest bun not nonexistent.;negative
DC's highest gun deaths per capita coincidences with the fact that guns are legal there, doesn't mean anywhere guns are legal crime rates will be high.;negative
Plus the DC area has fewer population so the 'per capita' figure will naturally tend to be higher.;negative
Still it does nothing to counter MBurke12's argument.;neutral
Actually, if you read the chart I gave you, you'll see that Chicago is ranked 15th.;negative
No, that's not just the order it is listed in.;neutral
Burke's arguement is specifically that places where guns are illegal has more gun deaths.;neutral
That's his arguement.;neutral
That's the arguement I answered.;positive
That chart shows conclusively that the opposite is true.;negative
The graph is based on per capita, so that DC has less people is completely irrevelant.;negative
You do know what per capita means don't you?;neutral
That means it's taking into consideration the population.;positive
You are just going to have to face the fact that places where guns are legal, have more gun related deaths.;negative
That's the arguement Burke put forth.;neutral
That's the arguement I rebutted.;negative
And the facts show conclusively that I am correct.;negative
I'm not sure what your arguement is at all.;negative
Look at some European countries that banned guns.;neutral
Guess what nothing has changed.;neutral
If people want to kill they will and they will find a way to get a gun to do so!;neutral
So you want to get rid of hunting, which is a trillion $ a year industry and if you ban guns millions of jobs would be lost.;negative
YOU THINK WE ARE IN A RECESSION NOW!;negative
You idiot!;neutral
in Maryland it is illegal to carry a firearm anywhere but a firing range and your own home.;negative
PWND;neutral
In case you different do other research, Chicago has one of the highest crime rates in the entire country.;negative
Crime rates equals criminals which means if guns are illegal, they must be getting them from somewhere, hmmm, i wonder where, black market or illegal selling across borders anyone?;negative
ever since we put registration on guns and making guns harder to get school shooting started.;neutral
we need to allow students to carry concealed guns on campus.;neutral
with the VT shooting if one student had been allowed to carry a gun on them the shooter would have ended it early and many people would still be alive today.;negative
it needs to be a law that we enforce to make every home have at least on gun to protect your self;neutral
Hey I'm all for gun rights but not on campus.;neutral
Think of all the hormonal students waking up early every morning (god knows what they did last night) and going to class with a sidearm in their jacket.;neutral
What happens when a fist fight between two boys turns into a shootout.;neutral
Then the next thing you know someone sees their friend getting shot at and they pull a gun.;neutral
Next thing you know theres about ten kids with guns drawn shooting at each other.;negative
I think that might create a few more deaths on a regulaur basis than once in a schools lifetime a single shooter.;neutral
But I remeber hearing that in one school shooting students had shotguns in their car that they got to and they brought down the attacker.;negative
I think that is acceptable but not unregestered guns in students back pockets.;negative
You live in Holliwood movie I see.;neutral
But after the movie the actors are alive.;positive
In the real world if you have Rambo everywhere you will have killed people everywhere and guess who will be killed - good or bad.;negative
Wake up or drink your drugs on time.;neutral
Have you actually read the newspaper?;neutral
There are several cases and some that a gun prevented them from being a dead victim.;negative
I speak from experience.;neutral
As for the easy access of guns, criminals would have access to guns in the black market regardless if they banned guns.;negative
Cocaine is illegal but some how people still gain access to it...well, how does that happen?;negative
1,145 times a day handguns are used against robbers.;negative
416 times each day women use their handguns to protect themselves from rapists.;neutral
Overall, a gun in the home is 216 times more likely to be used in self defense than to cause the death of an innocent victim.;neutral
And even if you don't own a gun, preserving the right of your neighbors to own them is one of the best ways to keep criminals out of your neighborhood.;positive
hey i agree but where did you get your facts from...............................................................;neutral
Well look at prohibtion in 1919 and on, also known as the Volstead act.;neutral
Alcohol was completely banned yet everybody still drank.;negative
They found ways to drink.;neutral
People had to brew underground, and drink in underground bars, but it happened.;neutral
Even major Authorities including police and judges were found down there.;negative
The same things would happen with guns, and who would be the people to illegally own guns?;negative
Not harmless hunters, but gangsters and other criminals who are dangerous with such weapons.;negative
It is still going to happen.;neutral
Maybe we just need tighter gun laws when purchasing them.;neutral
If we outlaw guns that stuff will still happen because they are already illegally getting guns.;neutral
yous a jock bum son stick to football girl.;neutral
So what your favorite football team?;negative
His argument sounded much more thought out then yours.;neutral
I'm just sayin';neutral
just because you make it illegal to buy a gun you will never and i mean never get all the guns off the street because the import guns illegally they buy guns without ffa regulation and peple are not stupid and they will find a way to make themselves weapons such as the book writtem by Bill Holmes published in 2002 titled .50-Caliber Rifle Construction Manual;negative
Look at China, UK, Australia...homicides in general and crime rates have RISEN since their gun bans...yeah sure they're less GUN deaths but they're more DEATHS in GENERAL.;negative
"Search up ""China Stabbings"" on how 1 knife killed 11 people.";neutral
Guns take life, guns save lifes.;neutral
Having no guns just will cause lives to be lost.;negative
accoding to my statstics thats still a quater of the american homocide rate.;negative
also i dont tink that the knife crime is a valid arguement seing as im pretty sure you get more than 11 rounds in a gun.;negative
im not trying to argue that stopping guns will prevent crime, but im pretty sure that if the person in china had had a gun, it would have been a hell of a lot worse;negative
No cases where an innocent peson has defended themselves with a guin???????;negative
Either you are under twelve years old or you have done zero research.;negative
There are hundreds of thousands of cases of innocent people protecting themselves with guns.;negative
Woman agains gun control, the second amendment police department are only two places that will tell you how many times innocent people not only have protected themselves but even assisted the police.;negative
Okay ingenious, let's think about this.;positive
So your going to keep Law-biding citizens from accessing guns so all the law breakers can go out and shoot all the law-biding citizens just to simply protect the estimated 5,000 people from getting killed by Gun Shot Wounds, when really you just killed those 5,000 people along with the other 500,000 people that we're law-biding.;negative
Yes guns should be banned in America.;neutral
In the UK, deaths by guns are a lot lower.;negative
The reason is that it's still harder for the average man in the street to obtain a gun.;negative
"The American Constitution states ""The right to bear arms"" and the Americans seem to feel really strongly about protecting this right.";positive
Obviosly the constitution is held in high esteem to the Americans, based on their history and pride of independence.;positive
However you can't hold onto values and laws that have lost their importance or value.;neutral
At the time of the American Declaration of Independance, which, I imagine would have led to the drawing up of the rules in the constitution, life and times were completely different.;negative
Shootings and murder were everywhere, and if I was George Washington writing a proclamation for a new world, then it makes perfect sense to give the citizens of this new world, the right to defend their land, property, and life.;positive
And for this reasons Americans have guns.;positive
But, if you can't get hold of one, you can't kill someone with it.;negative
It's a simple argument really, guns kill.;neutral
Guns should be banned and there will be extremely low cases of gun related murder.;negative
If guns over the world is banned, we will get world peace for a while.;positive
That is completely ridiculous.;negative
If guns were banned, people would get the elsewhere (ever heard of the black market???);negative
and the law abiding citizens would be defenseless.;negative
And world peace???;positive
There is no way that's possible right now no matter what you ban.;negative
Guns are not the only way violence is carried out.;negative
Do your research.;neutral
people will still get guns and whats going to happen to all the guns all over the world.;negative
there will never be world peace.;positive
there will always be weapons.;neutral
people will always kill other people.;neutral
its as simple as that;neutral
Peace for a while?;neutral
Is that why we have had wars globally for thousands of years before guns were invented?;neutral
Is that why schools and churches are shot to pieces and gun shows are not?;negative
itz gud 4 everybody cuz it helps u alot on eveyry problem u gt no matter wat;negative
i don't think we should ban all guns, but certainly some.;neutral
if you want to hunt, then go ahead a buy a hunting rifle, but what if the purpose of a gun other then that.;neutral
getting one for protection is stupid since there are many other options you have before resorting to a gun for protection.;negative
think about getting an alarm, moving to a low crime area, or buying a guard dog.;neutral
i think guns such as AK-47's are overkill and should be banned.;negative
do you really need a machine gun to kill a little deer?;negative
Guns are an awful thing.;negative
This world would be SO much better without them.;neutral
Crime and stupid people are such a bad thing.;negative
The world would be so much better without either, and the rest of us could own entire armories and never have a problem.;negative
Yes because not only can people kill others they can kill themselves;neutral
People KILL each OTHER!!;neutral
THEY COULD BE USED TO KILL OR ASSANATE THE PRES;negative
However, Japan has an extremely peaceful society (except for the Yakuza), and they have a ban on most forms of weaponry.;neutral

Guns should be banned because all it would cause is more crime rates in America and yes i know even if guns get banned people would still find a way to get but at least there won't be so much crime going as it would be if it gets banned;negative
they are killing people.;neutral
BAN THEM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;neutral
Criminals kill people.;neutral
Let's ban them.;neutral
Real affective huh?;neutral
Guess what dude, I have many guns and I've never hurt a soul.;neutral
Phooey with your little ban daydream.;negative
Guns don't kill people on their own.;negative
People kill people by using guns.;neutral
And besides, do you think a lot of gang members buy their guns in a gun shop?;neutral
Nope... Most gun crime comes from gangs and criminals who get their guns illegally.;negative
The legal guns are owned by the police, home owners (for protection), and hunters, etc.;negative
"with regards to ""guns dont kill people on there own"" no the dont however their sole purpose is to kill and without a gun it is harder to kill someone (granted you canuse other weapons however they are generaly less effetive and arentgoing to harm as man people)";negative
with regard to the fact that most gun crime is from illegl guns, in that case why not make all guns illegal.;negative
i maintain that making guns illegal would make it harder for people to get hold of them.;neutral
But you missed the point that by making guns illegal, criminals are still going to smuggle them as much as they currently do.;negative
And their only purpose is not just for killing.;negative
I would love to own a gun just for show!;positive
Like a vase or a painting.;neutral
I'd also love to shoot a gun just for fun.;positive
i only wish all people out there wanted it just for show, then i would have no issue with it.;negative
unfortunately im pretty sure that a majority of people want it for other reasons;negative
"Yes and that ""other reason"" is protection.";neutral
The only people who would buy a gun in a legal manner for an illegal activity are the kinds of people with nothing to live for or no common sense.;negative
Either way, they are not going to use that gun very long.;negative
of course they kill people.;neutral
bloody yanks.;neutral
why is the combined iq of your population 4;negative
so do cars, and stds,and fast food, and radiaton from the sun.;positive
lets bann driving and sex and a quick meal and while were at it lets just cover the sun up to.;neutral
thats a niave and stupid comment, while driving etc is dangerous, the sole purpose of a gun is to kill people.;negative
cars are useful and when used correctly arent dangerous, could be wrong but im pretty sure without sex we'd become extinct, and without the sun wed die;negative
guns have the sole purpose to kill and theres no need to be allowed;negative
Look at murder suicide rates other places.;neutral
It is a no brainer...;neutral
In England, people have realized that guns just create more violence and therefore, they have banned them.;negative
And it did them good.;positive
The US's murder rate is 15 times higher of that in England.;positive
(That's a lot!!!);neutral
Most murders involve guns.;neutral
The most common argument against banning guns is that people should be able to defend themselves.;neutral
But most likely they would be defending themselves against guns.;neutral
But if you got rid of guns, you wouldn't be needing to really defend yourself.;negative
Yes people can get get killed other ways too, but guns are the most common way, and guns only are really used for violence.;negative
It takes a lot of rage, strength and energy to stab someone, but it only takes a twitch of a finger to shoot someone.;negative
GUNS SHOULD BE BANNED!!!!;neutral
maybe we shouldnt be looking at how people are being killed but who is doing it.;neutral
fact is go in any prison and what color do you see?;positive
black and brown.;neutral
so if your going to get a handle on violence then get rid of the problem causers not one of our only ways of defending ourselves from them;negative
Guns dont create violence.;neutral
they are made of metal and cannot kill anything.;neutral
If your logic is true then carfs cause drunk driving.;negative
In england, they not only prosecute anyone for defending themselves, they also pay the criminals for their defense.;negative
You could not pay me to live in England.;negative
By the way, there were centureis where guns did not exist, yet people felt the need to defend themselves.;negative
Why do you think that is?;negative
Because the mind of the criminal is the problem, not the gun.;negative
No, guns should not be banned, and the day YOU face a violent attacker you will learn that the hard way.;negative
Although bearing arms is a right in America according to the constitution, it should still be illegal!;neutral
the U.S. constitution is broken beyond repair!;negative
Guns are becoming more easier to purchase and people are becoming more insane.humans are killing more innocent people everyday!;negative
the only proper way to stop this epidemic would be to ban guns from all local citizens and only give guns to military or law enforcement!;negative
great idea!;positive
go run for senate.;neutral
so what do we do with att the guns people have now?;neutral
o lets go to their house and get them.;neutral
ya thatll work since some of the people that own guns illegally dont even have a ss# cuz they snuck over here.;neutral
police are not your personal body gaurd, it is your responsability to protect yourself.;negative

ignorance isnt bliss;positive
Does that means the freedom of speech should be banned what about religion and right to an attorney i guess that means we shouldn't have any of these either.;positive
Actually violent crime rates are going down will more an more people are owning guns.;negative
have any of you actually SEEN Bowling for Columbine???????;neutral
ya look these kids were messed up.......and got there hands on guns anyway but look at it like this.;neutral
had every teacher, janitor, principal,etc in that building had a gun how many peoples life's would have been saved??;negative
accidents caused by contingent actions;neutral
people suffering from mental illness and minor may use a gun in wrong ways;negative
I say that guns should be banned because they are killing thousands of people each week;neutral
Then cars should be banned because they are using drunk drivers to kill people every weekend.;neutral
And I betcha plenty of those drunk driving murderers would not own a gun because they think it is too dangerous.;negative
"Saying,""";neutral
".""";neutral
"is like saying,""I say that people should be banned because they are killing thousands of people each week";negative
Okay i wish there was both sides because to be honest i am doing a project on this and i really wanna do both sides.;negative
we should banned guns because in the year of 2012 and of course 2011 there have been many killings, deaths, and shoot outs.;negative
shoot outs at SCHOOL!;neutral
Come on and im pretty sure there will be many more that's sad and crazy.;negative
anyways, there's been kids dying from guns that either accidently went off or one is shooting one another.;negative
its not so much their fault for having the gun its for the people who sells CHILDREN Guns illegaly and i doubt they wont stop because to them that's like their salary, the money that pays bills.;negative
not to long ago a little girl in 3rd grade (i think, but she was young) got shoot by a little boy because he had a gun in his bag and it accidently went off when he set his bag down.;neutral
kids my age dies like everyday that's scary.;negative
and there's people that will shoot someone for no reason.;negative
this is the part that is confusing but makes sence why i agree to having guns but also shouldn't.;negative
people say we should have guns because i can keep my children safe.;neutral
i can protect myself from people that is robbing me.;neutral
like for real that's good reasons but you can also kill someone just trying to protect yourself.;neutral
(i hate death if you cant tell) so when the police ask you what happen you'll just say i killed someone because they were robbing me.;negative
like they already got their consequence because you killed them, so what about your consequence you just killed someone!;neutral
that's murder!;neutral
either if it was an accident, trying to defend your self doesnt matter i think you should at least get consequences (they prob.;negative
do but i just dont know).;neutral
like if someone was beating you up and you fight back you will get in trouble for fighting back.;negative
so why is it different from shooting someone and killing them.;negative
Hope you liked i kind of went off track(: but yeah.;positive

guns should be banned because kids can get killed and there is shootings in the sua almost every week get a life and stop guns;negative
please stop guns in the usa help others and help the poor;positive
"The british aren't going to invade, so we don't need to protect ourselves"".";negative
So when an american enters you're home with intent to kill, are you going to defend yourself with a fork?;negative
I do agree that most burglary's that occur do not involve a murder or serious injury, but not all home invasion's are with the intent to remove your property.;negative
If I we're in the position to put my life on the line, or lose a television, I would rather lose the television.;negative
The question is whether this person is here to steal my property or harm me or my family.;neutral
I would rather have the means to protect myself and my family.;positive
If we lived in a perfect world where we didn't have Poverty, Drugs and Poor Education, then maybe I could see youre point.;negative
The fact of the matter is we don't.;neutral
When America gets to the point where I can go to sleep at night, or even go about my daily business and not worry, then I'll consider getting rid of my gun.;negative
Until then, we live in a dangerous world where people live outside the law and I feel safe knowing theres an amendment granting me the right to defend myself.;negative
YES!;neutral
beacase in country there guns are ileagle the criminality is way lower than america;neutral
stastistic shows that;neutral
It is morally better to yell and scream at an armed attacker than to shoot them.;negative
Guns in the hands of stupid people are dangerous.....we should also ban stupid people.;negative
Everyone knows that a pregnant woman, an old person, or a person in a mobile home could excape trouble by hiding in their bedroom with a criminal in their home and calling the police who are miles away.;negative
Private citizens, who are alone in their homes, dont need guns, they need to rely on the police, who travel in groups, have radios, and carry guns.;negative
The second amendment says MILITIAS have the right to carry guns, not private citizens, and that is why the militias are there to protects us and are composed of....private citizens.;negative
Guns are extremely dangerous, and thats why schools which are gun free zones as are churches are not targeted by violent criminals while guns shows and reenactments are replete with criminal violence.;negative
Who needs a gun when you can dive under your bed and be safe from a criminal?;neutral
A criminal might take you gun and use it on you....especially if it is better than the one he is carrying and since he can get to you before you pull the trigger.;negative
Columbine was safe because it was a gun free zone and the guys who did the shooting were simply;neutral
law abiding citizens who happened to have nasty guns.;neutral
Besides, all was well once they called the cops.;negative
Having a gun in the home of a private citizen who takes it out now and then for target shooting is more dangerous than a car in the hands of a citizen who drinks himself silly every weekend.;negative
I have a framing hammer in my car.;neutral
This girl next to me is alive not because I have no gun and cannot bring it in, and amidst screaming people, shoot her, but because I have a framing hammer in my car they would not notice...and I have no desire to harm her which I could do within seconds.;negative
It would take me less than a minute to kill her with my hammer.;negative
A split second to shoot her.;neutral
Neither of my implements pose her a threat because I am not a murderer.;negative
If I desired to kill her, not one of these people or ten thousand cops could stop me within the next two minutes.;negative
The data is irrefutable.;neutral
Countries that ban guns or implement stricter laws concerning firearms have lower crime rates.;negative
The right to own a weapon is not, nor should it be, a fundamental right.;negative
If there were no consequences to gun ownership, I would certainly support allowing all guns everywhere.;negative
But there are consequences.;negative
Guns kill people just like fists kill people, except it is much easier to erroneously kill/injure with a gun.;negative
I dispute the claim of self-defense rights.;negative
It is indisputably safer to not own a gun than to own a gun, save for the rare case when the area is so dangerous that using the gun to save oneself is statistically more likely than using it to kill oneself/others, on accident or otherwise.;negative
And all of these special cases exist only because guns exist in the first place.;negative
Remove them all and violence drops dramatically (after all, there is no such thing as a drive-by knife fight).;negative
The mission to remove guns from the streets is akin to the drive to promote world peace.;negative
In fact, they are essentially the same thing.;neutral
Although promoting peace can have consequences (often, it creates conflict) the less war there is the better.;negative
It is the same with guns.;neutral
The unique factor that makes guns, like war, so worth fighting against is that they cause significant collateral damage.;positive
They fuel drug cartel violence, they contribute to accidental deaths and suicides, and they often kill innocent bystandards.;negative
Other weapons?;neutral
Not so much.;neutral
The attempt to ban guns begins at the supreme court.;negative
"The 2nd ammendment must be re-interpreted under its primary intention, ""militia.""";negative
Militia, in today's speak, means locally stationed military, or just military.;positive
If reinterpreted correctly, this law does not protect gun owners.;negative
Next, the federal government would coordinate with states to completely eliminate all production of new guns in the country, and ban the importation.;negative
This would stifle the supply to almost zero.;negative
Finally, gun buyback programs and phased-in laws against gun ownership would slowly remove the remaining guns.;negative
This would require a lot of effort, and a lot of redneck outrage, but it would all be worth it in the long run.;negative
To the few people every year who get attacked by people and theroretically could have saved themselves if they had a gun (and also the assailant did not have a gun (and the victim could not have just defended with a knife)), sorry.;negative
You will die, but for the benefit of millions of victims and victims' families.;negative
I conclude with this statement: the less opportunities we have to kill, the less we do.;negative
"Why just for a simple ""Redneck"" as you have stereo typed me and my fellow gun owners, I have to say your an uneducated blind, ignorant person.";negative
People have been doing evil things since the beginning of time and guess what the criminals have always been armed with weapons that match that time period.;neutral

And the right to own my firearms and my right to my second AMENDMENT was fought for by my ancestors, which probably unlike you can be traced to the revolutionary war.;negative

I can hardly understand how this is not obvious, you have lost an unknown number of normal people today at a cinema screening.;negative
That should not be allowed to happen so easily, how can America let it?;negative
I have seen comments in the NEWS FEED which suggest that this is not a suprise for the area!;negative
My mind boggles, if someone is shot it should be a suprise!;negative
If you did not do everything humanly possible to prevent the possiblility that someone with the capacity to kill could have hold of a weapon with that capability then that is ridiculous.;negative
If the sacrifice you have to make is to hand over a gun which you cant prove you need for any good reason enough to keep it then that is a small price if it might save one life.;negative
The right to arms is out of date, just because people have them already is a weak excuse, maybe it will take 20 years to get it in order but every year will be a bit safer than the last.;negative
If you have a gun in your bag then that suggests you would consider using it, taking a life is a big deal, what if you missed, shot in a struggle through a window, or across the road.;negative
Guns kill because if point your fingers and say bang nobody dies.;negative
If you have a gun to protect yourself its a good bet that your attacker has one too, maybe if they were banned then they wouldnt have one... or so much confidence.;positive
Hand in your weapons because every time someone is shot you know it might just have been prevented.;negative
The easier it is to get hold of guns, the greater the likelihood of people being fatally shot.;negative
I realise that criminals and mentally afflicted people are unable to own guns legally, but since you can't predict who is going to commit a crime or develop a mental illness in the future, that doesn't offer much protection if somebody suddenly has a psychotic episode and goes on a killing spree.;negative
In Singapore we don't have peoples going around on killing spree!!!;negative
I find America's obsession with guns fascinating.;positive
Because the founders of your country wrote a document hundreds of years ago stating that everybody has the right to bear arms means that this document cannot be challenged to suit a modern era many years later?;positive
What makes this Constitution infallible other than how much importance is placed on its merits by the people?;neutral
No single document or set of laws is infallible.;negative
Basic logic.;negative
The fact is there is a strong correlation between legal guns and higher homicide rates.;positive
More Americans are killed by guns every year than all other developed countries combined.;negative
No problems with guns I hear you say?;negative
"Also, inb4 ""some countries where it is legal to obtain guns have low crime rates"".";negative
Using a few examples to justify a larger picture painted by the correlation between gun ownership and higher homicide rates is intellectually dishonest debate fodder.;negative
"And quite frankly, I am sick of hearing the tired old phrase ""guns don't kill people - people do"".";negative
Yeah, people kill people.;neutral
But what are my chances of going on a murder spree using a screwdriver vs a loaded gun?;neutral
Idiots.;neutral
I my point of view guns shoul be benned not only in America but in other countries also.;negative
Guns should be used only in military.;negative
Let us think why nowadays there are a lot of terrorists, of course because of guns and other veapons.;negative
They became available to a society and imagine how many families have suffered from it, how many mothers have losen their child?;negative
but anyway they MUST be used in military only.;negative
despite the fact that they can damage someones life guns could be the only way to protect us,what the military is succesfuly doing.;negative
i think guns should be banned but only in public because if guns were banned even in homes then it could be like when they banned alcohol.;negative
people would find ways to get guns and hide them from police.;neutral
not only would it begin another prohibition(except with guns) but the black market would have more things to sell.;neutral
if we got rid of guns then the police could defend themselves easier;neutral
Guns have the sole intention to kill people.;neutral
Rather than this guns aren't used for anything else.;negative
While committing a murder with a knife or a bat is considered a misconduct, guns where only designed to kill.;negative
Knives and bats were developed for other causes rather than killing.;negative
But guns aren't used in any other way.;negative
In addition guns are even more lethal than knives because one can accidentally kill someone due to uncontrollable firing.;negative
This especially applies to assault rifles and submachine guns that fire multiple rounds per pulling the trigger.;negative
Where as with a knife only one person can be targeted.;neutral
Another point for the gun ban is that people with criminal intentions can easily get access to guns and weapons.;negative
America has seen this during the past 20 years the gang violence the frequent gun-related homicides and the brutal massacres such as columbine, Virginia Tech and now New Town Connecticut.;negative
By giving these people (or any people at all) access to these weapons multiple people can be killed in just a matter of seconds and most importantly guns can be acquired legally.;neutral
But for what cause?;neutral
What could you possibly need a gun for?;neutral
For hunting but only with a license and any deliberate murder would be considered a misconduct because hunting rifles where intended to kill animals and that is a legitimate cause for killing.;negative
But since cannibalism is extremely scarce people say they need guns for protection.;negative
But from what?;neutral
There's the police there's the FBI that protect but just normal residents why do they need guns.;negative
Every single time people have a conflict they don't try to peacefully solve the problem.;negative
A lot of them would just go crazy, grab their gun and start shooting at the other person they were having their conflict with.;negative
If they wouldn't have guns they might think two more times before reverting to the gun.;neutral
People always think violence is the answer I can assure you it isn't and those that think violence isn't caused by guns but by people they should know that guns foster this violence and even intensify it on a catastrophic scale.;negative
The worst part of all is that because of the gun sales and the simplicity of acquiring a weapon, criminal organizations are heavily benefiting from this as well.;negative
The Sinaloa cartel and various street gangs can simply order people to purchase weapons for them.;negative
If the opportunity weren't there it would be much more difficult for criminal organizations to acquire them.;negative
However criminal organizations can still smuggle weapons and get assault weapons but the ban on weapons could lower the murder rate and hinder organizations from bulking up with annihilating firepower.;negative
We should act fast and realize that we are protecting ourselves from the same thing that is supposed to protect us.;negative
Guns are wrong and we need to find an alternative method.;negative
The constant killing has got to stop!;positive
As a human I am disgusted as to the fact that people still want to buy guns despite the amount of death they cause.;negative
First let me say I am not against the sale of select weapons for hunting and farmers but no one else needs weapons and certainly no one needs fully automatic carbines or 12 gauge shotguns, why would anyone need weapons that are close to and are in some cases military grade??;negative
"The line ""guns don't kill people, people do"" is quite ridiculous as an argument for gun sales since it is ""people"" that the guns are being sold to!!";negative
It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.;negative
This is common sense, it's the reason why no countries are now allowed to make nuclear weapons, to say people deserve guns do defend themselves is to say places like Iran and North Korea should be able to make nuclear weapons to defend themselves and if you think that then clearly something is wrong;negative
I agree that gun should be banned.;negative
Guns are really dangerous, they can kill people imediately and people have sentisive emotions.;negative
No one can sure that when we are anger we can regulate ourselves with a gun belong.;neutral
Without a gun, we can fight him, it does not a big matter, but when we use guns, we cannot regret.;negative
The Illegalization of fire weapons in the USA is a MUST!;negative
Too many innocent people have died already Please act now!;negative
"I believe we should ban guns in America because it's time that we grow up and stop believing we're still living in the Wild West, that we're ""Top Gun"" fighters!";negative
It's time we snap out of our fantasies and paranoia fears that we need more guns to protect us from the other guy when it's pretty obvious that more people are killed within the safety of their own homes due to accidents or domestic altercations.;negative
I agree with Pres. Obama that the safety of our children must always comes first and has priority over our so-called constitutional rights to own a gun.;negative
We need to stop ENABLING serial killers who want to go down in a blaze of glory while taking innocent children, men, and women down with them.;negative

The true is that even if you had your two or three guns in a massacres you wouldnt be able to use any of those without to take a good part of the mass killing.;neutral

And what is the result at the end - Just a scene of a stupid bloody Holliwood movie.;negative
The true is that the only way to make America safer is to remove the guns completely from the American home and American streets.;negative
If owing a gun will be a criminal act all those gangs will be put in prisons for less than a week.;negative
The mad guys with mad plans will be put in the hospitals for a week.;neutral
And the country will become safe and nice place where you can walk even after 9PM.;positive
Look at the countires in the world.;neutral
Is America the safest one or not and why.;neutral
Having Senators aand Rep.'s talking that the gun would protect a teacher in a school or a child - isn't it a sign of madness.;negative
Those guys for sure shouldnt be let having guns.;neutral
If they are so mad how mad would be their kids.;negative
If there is a fine if you let a kid to smoke or drink before the age of 18 or 21 isn't it stupid to allow the same kid to learn to shoot with guns on aim.;negative
And of course the question comes - did God say - not kill (there was nothink like - not drink or not smoke).;neutral
Or the gun lobists think that the God will work for their lobbies too.;neutral
Is not a shame or fun for sure - it is a stupidity and fearlessness from the true but the punishment comes till the live time.;negative
The God is good but doesn't forget.;positive
So weird was to hear religious people stating that the guns are not the issue.;negative
They for sure are the issue.;neutral
The issue are the man and women that believe only in their guns and don't know how mental sick they are.;negative
There is no way to be sure that people will not use guns to harm or kill innocent people, like in the 2006 Pennsylvanian Amish school shooting.;negative
Guns offer too much power that some people will not use carefully and kill gratuitously.;negative
True, people kill people, no guns, but guns allow a person to kill many people in a short time.;neutral
if that nut didn't have a gun, how kids do you think hw wouldv'e been able to kill with a knife or club before being subdued?;negative
A gun gives that person the feeling like he is invincible, which makes it easier for him to go on a killing spree.;negative
If he wasn't able to get a gun, all those kids would be alive today, except maybe one.;negative
If gun owners would think of that, instead of there own selfish desires to have a gun, alot of children would still be alive today.;negative
Reports show that a small percentage of gun owners actually use a gun to defend themselves, there are more killed with a gun, than those using a gun to protect themselves, they cain't say it's used for selfdefense.;negative
with all the guns in the hands of so called law abiding citizens, why are so many children massacred today?;negative
where are they using there guns to protect?;neutral
Gun owners don't want to give up there guns because of there selfish desire to own one.;negative
"They want to say ""what about my rights"", whats more important, there desire to own something they will rarely use, or those childrens rights that was killed to grow up?";negative
They don't need it for food, thats what stores are for.;negative
I guess they just like to shoot helpless beings to see blood, what a minute, that sounds like that nut who shot all those kids!;negative
Maybe we really do need to outlaw guns.;neutral
who said shotguns isn't a deadly tool?;neutral
you ever see what damage it does to a body?;neutral
thats why the army uses them!!!!!!!;negative
I think guns should be allowed in schools only if the teacher or principal has at least two years of experience on how a gun works and how to shoot a gun and also for protection of the students;negative
I agree with you.;positive
The experience is very important!;positive

I firmly believe we need to ask ourselves is a gun in everyone's hand really the world we want to live in?;neutral
Guns need not be banned right away.;negative

That's our goal.;neutral
That is different from what is really taking place but that is our goal.;positive
Life and the preservation of Life is the most important thing.;positive
Our mission should be to preserve life.;neutral
"There is an unrealistic feeling of ""control"" that a gun gives you.";positive
Basically blinding people to think that somehow they can be above the natural Godly chaos of the world.;neutral
IF someone really wants to kill you, there's not much of a chance of you defending yourself.;negative
If you believe in a higher power there is no reason to be scared.;negative
If it the spirit within us all is collective than you really don't have anything to fear but fear itself.;neutral
As far as one post stating if we all had money and the basic essentials than there would be no reason for guns... I think this sentiment is spot on.;neutral
NOBODY ever discusses the real reason criminals have guns.;neutral
There are too many to name, but they all usually go back to an unhealthy relationship to money and greed in our society, the paper chase.;negative
I'm not saying we need to be communists.;negative
Even ancient Rome fed it's peasants in the street.;neutral
There is a civic as well as a spiritual responsibility we have towards mankind.;positive
We are all on the same side here.;negative
Our individual salvation depends on our collective salvation.;negative
You can't keep killing the problem.;negative
You must educate and preserve life.;neutral
On a small scale guns could be replaced with Tasers and other close range defense mechanisms.;negative
Guns initial purpose was to defend against the tyranny of government by forming militia.;negative
Which I would argue a gun or semi automatic won't do much against our current military.;negative
The 2nd Amendment is dated to say the least.;negative
It was meant for defending against Indians and the British.;neutral
I'm pretty sure the peaceful education of our enemies and ourselves has turned these foes into our brothers.;positive
The world is more educated than ever... and there are social networking sites and the internet which can disseminate information faster than ever.;neutral
We can either be part of a global arms race and kill ourselves or we can seek virtue, truth, and education in order to live in harmony.;negative
I will add that GUNS aren't really the issue at hand.;neutral
It's a disconnection to our spirituality.;neutral
And not a religious spirituality, a mankind spirituality that connects us all.;negative
If we really loved all life (not liked) but loved life we would be in favor of preserving it and educating the world to preserve it.;positive
Guns are just a reminder of our mortal beings and immortal souls.;positive
i think that guns are not bad but if they are used in a bad way then they can do realharm.;neutral
This is why people are dying because people are using the guns in wrong ways which will mean to veryy sad consiquences.;negative
Guns should be not BANNED but I think they should be a bit more restricted with more secured information on buyer of the gun.;negative
Yes, there should be guns in america because americe right now is turning into comunism and we need to fight back!;negative
if the guns were banned we would be in comunism or scared because the president has all the guns and he could kill us!;negative
Obama is a comunist and we need to fight back!;negative
• It will reduce murders and shootings.;negative
• People will not be able to feel safe if everyone can have a gun.;negative
• Children will be given a bad example when they see parents that have guns.;negative
• Statistics show that Canada, UK, and Australia have lower rates of gangs.;negative
This is because they ban guns.;neutral
• Mentally ill people might accidently use it if they get hallucinations or think they are in danger, even if they are perfectly safe.;negative
• The government can’t have any gun control.;negative
• Gun violence is making us lose billions of dollars.;negative
• It causes obstacles to economic growth.;negative
• We can’t let a shooting like the Connecticut shooting happen again.;negative
I personally think guns should be allowed, but with a license.;neutral
There are other uses for guns, such as hunting animals.;positive
Also banning guns won't stop gun crimes, as they can be simply gained illegally, such as smuggling.;negative
Here, in Canada, it has been discovered that by far the majority of guns used in the commission of a crime originated from the USA.;negative
Criminals smuggled them across the border into Canada.;negative
This PROVES gun control works.;negative
We need only tighten up our border, and the crime ends.;negative
Simple.;neutral
We had only recently begun to arm our border guards, which is ridiculous.;negative
Our border should not only have armed guards, but our military should be stationed along the border with the USA to keep your violence out of my country.;negative
Those caught smuggling arms into Canada should be shot on the spot.;neutral
No questions asked.;neutral
No trial.;neutral
Nothing.;neutral
End of.;neutral
This is a wonderful example of how crazy the anti gun people can get.;positive
im just here for a oral report due tomorrow....;positive

Idiots who say guns don't kill people.;negative
It is 10x easier to kill someone with a gun than with a knife.;negative
Guns are dangerous even though when they are banned people will still make them people think that they will still use them less people will use them less deaths will be by guns.;negative
It is only reasonable to ban specific guns like bazookas or really any thing found in the military.;negative
What do we do if we're mad in America then?;neutral
This restricts our flow of emotions.;positive
Guns can kill so many people in just a short amount of time.;negative
I have seen enough.;neutral
Even if people say that the gun is just the object and it is the person who sets the trigger, the government is not doing enough to look after people who do such mas murders.;negative
The social system is failing them and so the only way to protect society is to ban guns completely.;negative
This is a weapon that can be used for destruction by certain people.;negative
If the system is not able to stop people getting ready access to such weapon them then we must stop giving them guns altogether.;negative
Yes it should.;positive
Why do people need guns when leaving in such a protected place.;negative
in Japan here, the place is calming and not attacks can be heard, why not drop down those guns and make a world the calming place.;negative
The gun laws are outdated I myself am not American, but In my opinion guns should be banned, or have very strict laws placed on them.;negative
"I know the other side goes on about having ""a right to bare arms"", which is all well and good, but having studied american history, it is easy to see that the main reason guns and possibly the creed ""a right to bare arms"" itself existed as America was an incredibly lawless place at one time, and so people needed to have their own means of protection.";positive
But we're in the 21st century now, leave protection to those who's jobs it is to protect people, people who are well-trained like police officers etc.;negative
Simply, America's obsession with guns is little more than paranoia and a fear of change, and while some individuals may offer compelling arguments of why the law should stay, it's undeniable that a majority are simply afraid of change.;negative
This debate topic should be come and solved more early than today.;positive
It's already late to ban the guns.;negative
Most of the poeple in America are having the gun to protect themselves.;neutral
If the gun law is abolished, however, it's absolute that some poeple wouldn't give their gun to government.;negative
This will occur pople to increase their anxiety.;positive

This is an American Shame!;positive
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative

In some cases, the killer has taken the victim's gun and killed them.;negative

It's outdated.;negative
Seriously, when this law was written the were no automatic machine guns, the guns were heavy and hard to use, Native Americas were still attacking, and Slavery was still legal.;negative

"Humans ""Flight or Fight"" response.";neutral
You're more likely to defend yourself with a kitchen knife than running all the way to your safe and doing the combination, you'd be a goner.;negative
5.;neutral
Guns kill more people than any other weapon, and are a lot harder to defend against.;negative
You way way more likely to survive one stab wound physically unharmed than a gun shot wound.;negative
Plus, you still have a chance to defend yourself against a knife, how do you defend yourself against a gun?;negative
I think to a certain degree that they should be banned.;negative
For example, A MUTHA FUKIN M16 M60 FAL FN.;negative
Many people are killed, because of guns.;neutral
We should ban it.;negative

Bad people use guns to kill good people!;negative
So yes, guns should be banned in america!;neutral
To argue one side or the other, in terms in single events, is silly.;negative
The argument is death, because of the nature of a gun.;negative
Rarely is it so one sided.;positive
Why do people fixate on one topic?;negative
To focus on one issue as the core is illogical.;negative
1) First note, yes, guns can kill people, but ultimately people kill people.;neutral
Basic logic.;negative
This is an argument of purpose and existence.;positive
Just because something exists doesn't mean it has purpose, and if an object has purpose it has existence.;negative
What is the purpose of the firearm?;neutral
Many.;neutral
Yes, killing is one of them, but there are so many others (for example, the enjoyment of shooting large pumpkins...and yes, I do).;negative
Equally so, I could argue that as a human, you were created to breed and kill on the whole in order to survive as the fittest, but modern theories and cognition seem to provide a greater degree of purpose to humanity.;positive
Of course, most of it is BS.;neutral
2) Equating lower crime rates due to the ban of guns is absurd.;negative
Japan has a peaceful society because after World War 2, and as terms of their surrender, many impositions were put on them.;negative
As such, the country turned inward and began the foundation of modern Japan.;neutral
Make no mistake, guns or not, the Japanese were not exactly the epitome of peace up until recent times.;negative
The idea of self is not priority to the Japanese.;negative
Subsequently, this level of stress in Japan has given them the highest suicide rate in the world.;positive
Death by gun?;neutral
probably not.;negative
Death by , sure!;neutral
Key topic here, death.;negative
The UK with it's gun ban has seen a healthy increase in knife violence.;negative
From what I also read, gun crimes actually went up as well (yes, the nasty black market).;negative
But if you look at most statistics, the majority of these crimes are concentrated in heavily populated areas (this seems to corroborate with worldwide trends.);negative
.;neutral
See my argument #1...people kill people, especially when you cram them in a small, stinky space.;negative
Human nature.;neutral
Take away one thing, we'll either find it another way or find a substitute.;negative
3) The Constitution.;neutral
The right to bear arms has been beaten to death.;negative
The 2nd amendment was created in order to have a readily available militia, amongst a other minor things.;negative
Home defense?;neutral
sure, why not.;negative
The gun nuts (and I do own guns) tend to use this as a giant hammer, crying to the call of freedom.;negative
Ridiculous.;neutral
Get over it.;neutral
"It's ok to say ""I shoot guns because it's fun and makes me happy"".";positive
No shame in that.;negative
The ultimate issue is a Pandoras box, which actually applies to all kinds of ideas and objects.;negative
An idea or object is released to the world, and we want to tuck it away never to be seen again.;negative
This is setting everyone up for failure.;negative
Conceptually, it's like making a statement to a group of people, then retracting it...not exactly the solution.;negative
Guns should be legal, but reform should take place.;negative
Emphasis higher education as a requirement (as in mandatory classes), mandatory firing instruction (as in, mandatory classes), and mandatory testing of such (book and field) before you can purchase a firearm.;negative
Education people, that is the key to anything.;neutral
Will this solve the occasional gun crazies out there?;neutral
no.;neutral
But if you are spending your time worrying about the typical Columbine or Virginia Tech stories, get over it.;negative
You're more likely to die from a car collision than getting shot.;negative
"Yes, I'll hear ""You say that because it didn't happen to you"", or ""your wasn't shot at the grocery store"".";negative
You are correct, and it's a luxury I have.;positive
It's called objectivity.;neutral
if nobody had guns, nobody could kill people.;negative
no guns should be able to be sold over the counter to anybody.;negative
if there are to be any guns, then only to police and the navy/force.;negative
even this, people should have approved licenses.;negative
But if guns got banned do you think criminals who use guns would just give them to the government?;neutral
they would get arrested if they didn't, then get killed if they didn't.;negative
They would have to be found with a gun first.;neutral
Maybe the government of USA should not prohibit all weapons.;negative
First the government should get rid of nuclear weapons.;neutral
United Nations just deal with this problem at the moment.;negative
Kazakhstan leads the program.;neutral
More than 40 nations, including Kazakhstan, met in Washington in 2010 for the first summit and again in Seoul in March 2012.;negative

"President Nazarbayev made a “courageous and monumental decision” to remove all of the nuclear weapons from the country"", Limage said.";positive
Limage is the deputy assistant secretary of state in the State Department’s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation.;negative
Limage said the United States and Kazakhstan have been working together and with others to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and radiological materials through the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.;negative
I take the view that it is a global problem, not only in USA and also world over.;negative
I believe that people are able to protect the world against nuclear weapons.;positive
“The United States has taken bold steps toward nuclear disarmament,” Limage said.;positive
It is my view this is the most important;positive
I would love to live in a world where we didnt need nuclear weapons.;positive
Unfortunately, we do.;negative
Yes, most of Europe wants to give them up, but what aboout North Korea?;neutral
What about Iran?;neutral
If those 2 countries ever got one and one that worked.;positive
Iran is trying to make one, dont believe all that uranium is just for nuclear power.;negative
Ahmideinejhad himself said once he has nuclear capabilities, he would use them.;negative
N Korea tried launching some of their own.;neutral
Thank god they didnt work.;positive
As long as there are people out there willing to use them, everyone who has them should keep them in standby.;negative
The only defense for a nuclear attack is to send up our own nukes to intercept them, and we can.;negative
There are essentially two arguments for the ownership of/legality of guns in American (outside of the second amendment).;negative
1) Protection - The argument suggests that guns protect us from dangerous individuals.;neutral
The problem is that WE ARE the dangerous individuals.;negative
From accidents, to insanity, to alcohol or drug-fueled violence, we are the ones doing this damage.;negative
The best mode of protection is the removal of firearms from society.;negative
2) Entertainment/sport - Shooting is fun.;positive
I love it.;positive
Skeet, target, and hunting are fun pastimes.;positive
I was trained as a boy to properly care for, handle, and shoot a fire arm.;negative
I was 10 years old when I shot my first .22 and I was hooked.;negative
I would love to pass these skills onto my son, but not at the cost of so much death and destruction caused by the improper use of guns.;negative
I would rather pass on a safer society.;neutral
I've heard all of the arguments and both sides are certainly passionate about their beliefs.;positive
Here are some of my rebuttals to common counter-arguments.;neutral
Guns don't kill people, people kill people: absolutely true, but guns allow people to kill people with greater efficiency, which is not necessarily a good thing outside of the battlefield.;positive
If guns are outlawed, only outlaws would have guns: Actually, not true.;negative
Outlaws and law enforcement would have guns.;negative
Criminals will find ways to get guns: True, but the supply will be much lower the demand much higher, thus making it more expensive, thus more difficult, to get a gun.;negative
any of u frix ever heard of the black market???;neutral
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh!;neutral
So truuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue.;neutral
Guns should be banned because they are not needed in any domestic issue.;negative
The second ammendment was put in place because of fear that the british might invade america again or take control of the government.;negative
if this were the case the people would need weapons to defend themselves and regain america.;negative
The british aren't going to invade so we don't need to protect our selves.;negative
even in the this day and age america remains increadible safe compared to many other nations.;negative
we have no close enemies.;neutral
if a major army were to attack us a few men with pistols or shotguns wouldn't do much against a soldier with an ak47 or tanks or bombers.;negative
Guns in America just make it easier for crimes to be committed.;neutral
Some guns should never be considered allowed and this includes all semi automatic weapons as well as shotguns.;negative
Poverty, drugs, and lack of education are the reasons people turn to guns to kill.;negative
guns give you power to take life and should not be allowed to float around so that our students or citizens can use them against one another.;neutral
Guns may not kill people on their own but they greatly facilitate the killing of people and their sole purpose unlike most knives and axes is to kill.;negative
if we are allowed to carry a tool which sole purpose is to kill then purposely or accidentally we will harm or kill someone and that risk can't be allowed to exist.;negative
You are absolutely wrong about the second amendment being put in place to prevent a British invasion or coup.;negative
It was put in place partially to allow the creation of militias.;negative
You're also wrong about guns making crime rates go higher, take a look at Switzerland.;negative
Men there are required to own automatic weapons and yet they have next to no crime rate.;negative
Their lack of a standing army is what was originally for seen for the United States, or a system similar.;negative
A small standing army to form the core of a greater force in times of war.;negative
That is what the second amendment implies.;neutral
Obviously you know little about guns, a shotgun is probably one of the least threatening weapons to people.;negative
Their limited range for their weight and length makes them impractical for crime, but perfect for the defense of ones home.;positive
The guns aren't the problem its people and don't start blaming poverty, or education.;negative
Just because you're poor doesn't mean that you have to kill someone to improve your life.;negative
There are many ways to do that.;positive
So long as guns exist people will always find a way to acquire them.;negative
By reducing the number of honest, law abiding citizens with the capability to protect themselves from these criminals you're asking for a breakdown of order.;negative
But I diverge from the topic at hand.;positive
Point is only an idiot points a gun anywhere near a person they don't want to kill.;negative
There's no such thing as a gun related accident, gun related deaths almost always are caused by carelessness or stupidity or both.;negative
Great argument pvtNobody, I couldn't have said it better myself.;negative
Guns don't kill people, stupid people with guns kill people.;negative
"well if guns were banned stupid people would not be able to get the guns and kill the other people.Yeah, maybe you did not see when you wrote the ""stupid people WITH"" part.";negative
ban the damn things ban them all.;neutral
Then we should ban so stupid people can't kill people with guns.;negative
Why not provide more education to those with guns?;negative
Banning guns altogether is not a viable option and not even in the realm of possibility.;negative
While I don't think an outright ban is impossible, I do think better education and visibility is a good idea.;negative
For instance, every gun should be sold with a bright orange, lockable case with a flashing light on it.;negative
Every home containing a firearm should have a sign outside with the number of guns within.;negative
In short, gun ownership should be as conspicuous as possible.;negative
So we should make driving illegal because a relatively small fraction of the population chooses to drive drunk?;negative
"You make a good point pvtNobody, but at the bottom of the article in your supporint evidence it reads: ""It has none of the social problems associated with gun crime seen in other industrialised countries like drugs or urban deprivation.""";negative
Thus, I don't know if comparing the Swiss to the US with respect to guns is appropriate.;negative
Switzerland has a gun death rate of 6 in 100,00.;negative
America has a gun death rate of just over 10 in 100,000.;neutral
England outlawed all handguns and has a 0.6 per 100,000 gun death rate.;negative
[1] The facts are pretty clear that in countries where guns are allowed, more people are shot and killed.;neutral
In 1999, there were 28,874 gun-related deaths in the United States - over 80 deaths every day.;negative
In 1999, 58% of all gun deaths were suicides, and 38% were homicides.;negative
Of all suicides, 57% occurred by firearm.;negative
In 2000, 75,685 people (27/100,000) suffered non-fatal firearm gunshot injuries.;negative
What, exactly, is the point of guns?;neutral
The fact of the matter is that America has a culture where guns are OK, and the only thing that is ever going to do is mean a great increase in gun crime.;negative
Guns are pointless in this day and age.;negative
HUNTING AND SELF-DEFENSE, time to look past your little inner city cocoon.;negative
There is a big place called the rest of North America!;positive
Yes i could have phrased it better.;neutral
You are right about the militias but what was the purpose of them?;neutral
who were they supposed to defend against, not just the british but they were certainly a worry?;neutral
We have a standing army so why do we need a militia as well?;negative
I'm not a gun expert i agree but i also know that shotguns arn't the most dangerous weapons.;negative
Yet what reason does anyone have to own a shotgun?;neutral
I included shotguns because i feel that there is no justification for owning one not that i thought they were very dangerous.;negative
I'm not saying poor people resort to guns what i am saying is that poverty destroys people's lives and creates an atmosphere of fear.;negative
There are poor people who are living the best they can with what society has thrown at them.;positive
criminals or gangs might try to recruit the poor since they say they offer a better life.;negative
because of society the poor might feel that they don't have much hope and that being in a criminal organization might help to raise them.;negative
i understand that most of the poor don't do this but there are a few, especially in a city.;neutral
a large reason for our higher violence rates is our society and maybe not the presence of guns alone but guns make it easier.;neutral
just because a group in one area are able to control gun violence(like Switzerland) does not mean that a group somewhere else is.;negative
"""There's no such thing as a gun related accident, gun related deaths almost always are caused by carelessness or stupidity or both.""";negative
and thus wouldn't that be an accident?;negative
maybe only an idiot does point a gun near someone they don't want to kill there are still a few idiots in this world with access to guns.;negative
i understand your points about self defense and i think it is the only and strongest reason for not banning guns yet what guns are you talking about?;neutral
do you think we should be allowed to own semi-automatics?;negative
a lot of the recent gun deaths in the news were when people were not at home.;neutral
such as at Virgina Tech, do you think people should be able to carry guns to class or in public?;negative
what i'm trying to say is if you have a shotgun at home yet are confronted when you're away from home how much use is that shotgun?;negative
lastly i talked about education and poverty because most of the criminals are people who have been treated not well by society.;negative
there are those high level gangs that did well but where did they begin what reason did they have to go down such a path?;negative
there are too many gun deaths and while there will never be a ban in America i find it appalling that so many fight to prevent gun restrictions and background checks.;negative
Militias still have their place, the National Guard is in a sense a militia.;negative
It's composed of soldiers who train regularly but are not professionals.;neutral
Historically it was not the Continental Army that won the American Revolution but the militias that fought alongside the army.;negative
I would argue that if you are pointing a gun at someone it is not an accident if the gun goes off and kills the person you are pointing it at, period.;negative
The only restriction on whether a person can own a gun should be passing a gun safety course.;negative
A shotgun has many uses, and in many ways a shotgun would be a better self-defense weapon than a handgun it has significantly more stopping power and is much harder to conceal.;positive
If you have your shotgun with you then it's a lot of help.;positive
There is a significant number of people in the US that carry weapons in their cars for just the sort of situation you describe.;positive
That is also the reasoning behind obtaining a concealed carry permit.;negative
Finally you bring up societies mistreatment of people.;neutral
I honestly believe that people's lack of education and even to some extent poverty is more often than not a result of their own failings.;negative
I would be remiss to say that all poverty was something that those stricken by it brought it upon themselves but many poverty stricken people perpetuate their status.;negative
More importantly a lack of scholarly education or wealth is no excuse for going on a crime spree.;negative
"In short I'll fall back on the tried and true motto, ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people.""";negative
It's hard to argue with that logic, modern guns have so many safeguards built in that it is not often that they go off without someone pulling the trigger and never if it's not loaded.;negative
mmm, yes, If we take Switzerland as an example again, they have compulsory consription for all young men where they learn about their automated weapons, discipline, responsibility and all that jazz.;negative
It also effectively renders the entire able bodied male population of Switzerland potential, trained militia.;negative
Service is optional for women there.;neutral
Prehaps an educational camp is what is needed for responsible gun ownership.;negative
I just want to clarify one point.;negative
you are aware that semi-automatics are just guns that reload once after shooting, not guns that can shoot two or more bullets per trigger pull, right?;neutral
Because the latter is illegal in the US and in most places.;neutral
(well not exactly, you can legally own burst-firing and even full autos in some states but it's a long and expensive process).;neutral
Also the large majority of guns owned are semi-autos.;neutral
And one more thing shotguns are probably the best guns for hunting any fowl.;negative
Ever heard of target shooting or hunting?;neutral
Also what if you have a varmint problem?;neutral
And even if you ban guns criminals can still buy guns illegally and then the only people with guns would be criminals...and the police, but what if the police aren't around shouldn't you have the right to defend yourself?;negative
Also guns don't mean that people are more likely to commit crime or even kill people.;neutral
Look at Switzerland, they have the second highest gun ownership rate in the world (second only to the USA), and a large percentage of those are government issued assault rifles, yet they have a much lower crime rate than the US.;negative
The problem isn't guns it's poverty and lack of education we should be working on those instead of blaming guns for all our problems.;negative
Shot guns are used for many different application a few of which are bird hunting like pheasant or ducks, they can also be used for trap and skeet shooting.;negative
Another thing shotguns have a maximum shot distance of 30 yards so they aren't that good of a weapon.;negative
Also semi-automatic weapons have various uses and when you are hunting fast animals you want to be able to take as many shots as possible without having to cock the gun.;positive
Another point is that a gun is a tool and the person is the one who kills someone not the gun.;negative
And it is now required to take firearm safety to purchase or use a gun and also 80% of guns used in crimes are bought illegally according to the FBI.;negative
"""The british aren't going to invade, so we don't need to protect ourselves"".";negative
So when an american enters you're home with intent to kill, are you going to defend yourself with a fork?;negative
I do agree that most burglary's that occur do not involve a murder or serious injury, but not all home invasion's are with the intent to remove your property.;negative
If I we're in the position to put my life on the line, or lose a television, I would rather lose the television.;negative
The question is whether this person is here to steal my property or harm me or my family.;neutral
I would rather have the means to protect myself and my family.;positive
If we lived in a perfect world where we didn't have Poverty, Drugs and Poor Education, then maybe I could see youre point.;negative
The fact of the matter is we don't.;neutral
When America gets to the point where I can go to sleep at night, or even go about my daily business and not worry, then I'll consider getting rid of my gun.;negative
Until then, we live in a dangerous world where people live outside the law and I feel safe knowing theres an amendment granting me the right to defend myself.;negative
Strongly agree!;positive
"""If guns were against the law only criminals would own one.""";negative
Man where are you coming from, what about CHINA, have you studied the size of their military force, it is not to defend themselves.;negative
Are you are a control freak, I can read into your writings, into power, or YOU have access to any weapon you want and want to keep that control from everyone else.;negative
I wish you lived in a location struck by the Huricane, you could defended all those folks which was raped and killed in the hospitals, in our own country.;negative
You can bet you would have disarmed them as well.;neutral
You cant stop guns, or crimes, or even drugs.;neutral
I am also a cop but not a control freak.;negative
You should be DEFENDING the Constitution not burning it down.;negative
good god bible bashes.;positive
READ THE DAM THING.if u use a gun u are a sinner according to that thing bound in black next to your computer.;negative
look at Europe as u have always done and see the light.;positive
Gun crime although it dose exist, is Minuit in comparisons with the USA which is out of control on GUNS.;negative
Guns don't kill people they just provide the means to do so.;negative
in a cowardly way.;neutral
in Uk cities u at least have a chance against your opponent when they have a knife...;neutral
OK someone brakes into your house, they have a Gun;negative
u have a gun.;neutral
u both shoot each other and die.;negative
take guns of the street and then there is no need in guns.;negative
:O shock.;neutral
ect scenario flawed.;negative
i admit it but still GUNS ARE NOT GOOD THINGS DUMMIES;negative
Wow, if someone was robbing my house with a gun I wouldn't be playing High Noon with them....;positive
Better than playing dead... After all dead men have trouble forming coherent sentences;positive
After sifting through the grammatical errors, I believe I have found the point you intended to make.;negative
The reality of statistics reveals that the UK's violent crime rate is far higher than that of the US.;neutral
The UK has effectively disarmed its responsible citizens, but done nothing to limit the black market of arms that criminals are utilizing to perpetrate the crimes.;negative
The result is that the criminals have a much safer job than they would if responsible citizens were armed.;positive
FINALLY.;neutral
Someone who pointed out that violent crimes in Europe ARE HIGHER.;neutral
Good lord.;positive
Stop listening to propaganda.;negative
In fact BBC recently did a report on how crime has gotten worse.;negative
Get y'alls head out of the sand.;negative
Europe's moving away from government intervention.;neutral
Were moving toward it.;positive
Europe's starting to realize that gun control fails.;negative
Were moving towards it.;positive
Why do we not look across the pond and realize how much it sucks?;negative
High crime, and high unemployment.;negative
Yes, guns should be banned.;negative
Guns provide a trigger for any violent activity in the society, like the Virginia University incident.;negative
In our normal life, we have a bad notion for a particular person and wish to kill him if he comes forward some day.;negative
This happens with EVERYONE.;neutral
He might be our naughty neighbour or prankster classmate.;negative
"We often say "" I will rip him into pieces if he argues again, some day"".";negative
Presence of guns around us just provide an acceleration to this kind of a thinking and encourages us to act upon him and kill that person.;negative
So, guns should be banned forever.;negative
You state that guns are a tool that increases the ease with which a crime may be committed.;neutral
But do any responsible gun owners succumb to rage and utilize the tool that they carry for protection of themselves and others to kill someone?;neutral
Aren't those feelings of rage and hate we feel internally slightly exaggerated?;negative
Would any sane, responsible person be able to act externally upon irritation, even with a tool readily available, to kill someone?;negative
I think not.;neutral
Serial killers and criminals buy their tools to kill.;negative
Responsible gun owners, the ones that follow all laws regulating gun ownership, will not use the guns they acquired for a wholly distinct and opposite purpose to kill or hurt others.;negative
Responsible gun owners simply don't come into it.;negative
Serial killers and criminals buy their tools to kill.;negative
True, but if they couldn't buy guns, then they would do alot less damage.;negative
Making a law prohibiting guns does very little to limit the availability of guns to a criminal.;negative
A criminal has no reason to abide by that law if he/she is going to break another one.;negative
The black market remains available regardless of what laws are used to disarm law abiding citizens.;negative
Uhhh?;neutral
You ever heard of a black market, the illegal selling,buying, and distribution of contraband (weapons,drugs) illegally?;negative
shut up you commie before i show you what a responsible gun owner can do!!!;neutral
you#%&@%;neutral
The responsible gun owners that you are talking about, might not necessarily THEMSELVES using guns.;negative
Womens and even CHILDREN in those houses feel like using those deadly toys and even try shoot at someone.;negative
I am not saying all this in fluke.;negative
Just click on the evidence below.;negative
http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DD1031F933A15754C0A965958260;neutral
After reading this, you might raise another point that the owners should be responsible and keep guns away and keep them safe.BLAH BLAH!;negative
But, then just answer this, ISN'T IT BETTER NOT TO BUY GUNS RATHER THAN BUYING AND HIDING IT FROM WRONG HANDS?;negative
Responsible gun owners know how to protect their guns from harmful use.;negative
In the old days KIDS went hunting and guns were a part of life, we had no issues with guns in the house.;negative
Now with the gun grabber attitude yes there is a problem, return guns and teachings about guns to our kids to be responsible.;negative
My 3 kids are pro gun and they know how to use them responsibly.;neutral
FACT, your kids may need some work.;neutral
All that means is there is two less idiots in the world.;neutral
Wait let me rephrase that, one less idiot and one less person that has the tendencies to commit murder.;negative
win win in my opinion.;positive
"And Virginia Tech was not an ""incident,"" it was a massacre.";negative
If all the students had also had guns then there is no way that asshole could have killed as many innocent people as he did.;negative
My condolensces to the families of the victims.;neutral
I would agree with you if you can 100% control all the guns out of criminals hand, including US government.;negative
If you think the government is awesome and do everything right for you and to you, then you are blind 110% of the time, all the time, everytime.;negative
Says who?;neutral
Says me, former information security engineer.;negative
Of course guns kill people, but that doesn't mean that they should be banned.;negative
Knives kill people, cars kill people, Big Macs kill people, but should they be banned as well?;negative
First of all, it would be impossible to ban guns and expect that they would all be taken off the street.;negative
They are too prolific in America now and there's no turning back.;negative
Second, guns serve a great purpose in many cases, people just need to be educated on proper gun safety.;negative
Additionally, we should do more to ensure the people who are getting guns are capable of handling them and are not likely to go kill someone with it.;negative
Well a gun is different than big macs and knives, because a gun was solely designed to kill things.;negative
And when someone says guns don't kill people, people do, that's like saying pencils don't draw, people do.;negative
You draw with a pencil.;positive
You kill with a gun.;neutral
It would be impossible to get rid of guns.;neutral
Of course it would be a bad thing because people love their guns for hunting, killing, etc.;negative
"If your ""great purpose"" of guns is death, than yes, they do serve a purpose.";negative
It's my personal belief that violence and hate only results in more violence and hate.;negative
If America stopped killing people, no one would hate us.;negative
The two reasons why people use guns in America:;neutral
1.;neutral
Get things like money, power, respect (kill people, hold up stores, stuff like that);negative
2.;neutral
Protect us from each other because we want money, power, etc.;negative
If we all had equal money, power, and respect, there wouldn't be any competition, therefore no hate, no greed, etc.;negative
We can outlaw guns all we want, but we're always gonna find ways to kill people.;negative
You gotta attack the root of the emotion that makes people want to use guns to make people realize gun's won't get any real work done.;negative
Na uh bum it was actually started for sporting events and protection bum.;negative
The Winchester family was wht started the killing bum.;negative
First of all bum they are normally used in a cause of rape, not robbery, robberry is ranked low in the standing bum.;negative
Your speaking like a communist.;neutral
"""If we all had equal money, power, and respect, there wouldn't be any competition, therefore no hate, no greed, etc.""";negative
If guns were never invented people would use bows, knives and swords to kill people.;negative
Weird, last I heard, people hunt animals with guns.;negative
You can also draw with a pen, and kill with a knife.;positive
Guns and pencils are tools, they have similar tools that can do the same purpose, too.;negative
It's the people who pull the trigger, stab the blade, draw on the paper, etc.;negative
happnen cheif xx so what do you think about guns x i think that they are great & i love shootin mine in all directions xx;positive
cee, shut up man?;neutral
nobody care's what you think.;neutral
your opinion isn't needed in this community ya dooshhhhhh!;neutral
Alright were talking about America we dont like socialism in America.;neutral
And for the record people use guns for sport and for hunting.;neutral
Sorry but that is bull.;neutral
Guns are already written into our history and there's no going back after over 200 years of supporting guns just because some people who weren't properly trained in the use and safety of properly handling a firearm.;negative
If guns are taken off the market it wont stop people who seek to cause trouble get their hands on a gun, yes it may make it a little more difficult but in the end you are just disarming good citizens who no longer have the ability to defend themselves.;negative
And people own guns for more than the two reasons you listed.;neutral
I own a rifle for hunting, shotgun for bird season, sidearm for personal defense, another sidearm for just shooting and a 22.;negative
rifle for the same reason.;neutral
people have been killing since the beginning of time, before it was guns it was swords, blunt weapons, bows, hell even rocks and bones.;negative
Eventually the primary source of inflicting harm could be another weapon or stay at the gun.;negative
my point is just outlawing one thing doesn't mean others wont find other ways of hurting one another.;negative
Removing guns from house hold is the worse thing you can do.;negative
Let me tell you exactly why as a Information Security Engineer (info sec / IT sec ).;negative
1) Law abiding citizen will obey the law.;neutral
Regardless if you want guns or not, criminals have ways to find one and kill you.;negative
2) Guns equalize the situation where cops will take 5 minutes minimum to bring some body bags to your house.;negative
You either want to use that body bag or you don't.;negative
3) Guns in America was not meant for hunting as a primary purpose.;negative
It is your second amendment right / duty to have one as our founding fathers have seen how government abuses its power to fellow citizens.;positive
Government should serve people, not the other way around.;negative
4) People kill people , not tools kill people.;negative
You say all you want that these equipment make it easier for bad people to do harmful things.;negative
However, would you also want to get rid of chances for law abiding citizen to defense themselves.;neutral
If you say the cops can do it then you are delusional.;negative
They don't have the jurisdiction to even search you or run to your house to do things on your property.;negative
Go find out about the law.;neutral
5) Countries that have extremely strict gun laws don't really work well either.;negative
Japan still has high crime rates, they just hide their news.;negative
People still kill each other in many different ways.;neutral
6) I do agree with fully automatic weapons can be ridiculous since you cannot hit anything accurately and should just spread the harm.;negative
However, having a regular semi-automatic firearms should not be excluded in any state or the country.;neutral
I suggest you go learn about firearms really well before you say stuff.;neutral
7) Law enforcement do agree that black rifles do not create crimes.;negative
Crimes were made by people who can't afford to have anything.;neutral
They purchased cheap crappy firearms in black market anyway.;negative
All can all.;neutral
I know that the bad guys will go to your house not mine for sure.;negative
Why?;negative
Because I am ready to defend myself and my family for the right of life and freedom of speech.;positive
Do you like Commie countries?;neutral
You can go to China and see how that feels.;neutral
Educate your children about firearms and proper manner in society is the key.;negative
Firearms are not the problem.;negative
US government themselves deals more than any other agencies in the world.;neutral
Go figure!;neutral
Your point was valid till you thought we should all be commys.;neutral
= things never work out geez ya scrub...........;negative
Communist these days are just a label on top of a country that has government placing crazy amount of restrictions to shape a society into something.;positive
But yes, I still say that word because it is absurd to tax civilian 50% plus on the middle class income.;negative
Go figure!;neutral
The reason some extreme Islamic people hate America is because they see us as the center of the Atheistic western world.;neutral
They would hate us whether we kill them or not.;negative
I agree with @kk0bbr's argument all except for point number two.;negative
If there we equal money, power and respect, the world would be chaos.;positive
Let's start with if there was equal money.;neutral
If there was equal money, many would not be content as greed is a large part in human nature, and the end result would be an even more imbalanced society as there would not be both rich and poor people to balance the scale, simply rich people and average earners.;negative
Next, if there was equal power.;negative
If there was equal power, the America would be a state of anarchy, resulting in uncivilization and no rules/laws for citizens to follow.;negative
If people made rules, they would have more power, resulting in a big jolt for the economy and the state of everyday activities.;negative
And last, if people had equal respect, we would have no-one to aspire to be like, no idol for us to follow the path of.;negative
We would be the same in a way.;negative
Also, it is impossible to keep everyone equally respected due to the fact that people engage in activities, which may decrease or elevate your level of respect given from others.;negative
Overall, I agree that it would not make a difference.;neutral
Guns do not kill people .;neutral
A gun doesn't have a mind of its own .;negative
A gun can not pull it's trigger by itself .;negative
There has to be a person on the other hand to pull that trigger .;positive
That person kills people not the gun .;negative
On the other hand every thing else you said I totally agree with you .;positive
Firstly, knives and cars are not commonly used to murder people.;negative
Cars just cause accidents, that is not the reason why cars should be banned.;negative
GUNS ARE A SURE WAY TO FINISH PEOPLE OFF!;negative
AND ANYONE CAN USE THEM TO KILL OTHERS, that is the reason why guns should be banned.;negative
Secondly, how do guns serve a great purpose, as you said, in many cases?;positive
They help to kill somebody we hate?;neutral
Well!;neutral
that is badly justified!!;negative
Moreover, there is no way of ensuring that the people who are getting guns are capable of handling them and are not likely to go kill someone with it.;negative
mmm, I agree with your first two points, however just because stupid people obtain guns is no reason to ban them.;negative
Stupid people are voted for all the time (you know who I mean) but does that justify preventing the election process?;negative
Jits;neutral
Both are used to 'murder' people all the time.;negative
It is true that guns are responsible for the majority of murders but knives are number two and cars are considered weapons by the police.;positive
Your point is that Guns murder people so they should be banned.;negative
If that truly is your sole point then that's riduculous because banning guns wont stop murders.;negative
"Murderers will just use something else; knives, poisons, explosives, their own hands.";positive
"Do you really think a criminal intent on killing will say to himself, ""Darn, I can't kill now because guns are illegal?""";negative

Do you collect anything, pez dispensers, baseball cards, broken hearts...anything?;negative
If you do maybe you'll be able to relate to the need for guns.;positive
Think about it.;neutral
Guns represent history.;neutral
Guns represent the ingenuity of man.;positive
Guns are one of the simplest, most efficient machines ever created.;positive
Take some time to look beyond the obvious...gun kill...gun bad.;negative
We are talking about guns here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;negative
I disagree with your point : Just consider the prime uses of the things which are considered weapons by you.;negative
Firstly, the prime use of cars are transportation.;positive
They are commomly used to move from one place to another by the common people.;neutral
You say that cars are considered as WEAPONS by the cops?;neutral
They are not considered as a WEAPONS.;negative
They are used by cops as roadblocks and chasing activities.;negative
Do you think them as MURDERS?;neutral
Quite funny though!;positive
That is a funny point you have raised.;positive
Secondly, just think about the prime use of a knife.;negative
They are commonly used in domestic kitchen activities.;neutral
Now, think about the prime use of a GUN.;neutral
Even a child knows that guns are used for killing.;neutral
(Other than defense in the army, obviously, guns can't be banned for the army).;negative
Then why not ban guns, when they kill.;neutral
Even the keyboard that you are typing on can be used to KILL people if hit at main areas of the body.;negative
All is on the mentality of the people.;neutral
And, as I mentioned in my first point, presence of gun can originate offensive mentality in the owner.;negative
JITS SAYS;neutral
"""Jeff Joseph, a law professor with the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, said police officers are often held blameless in San Diego County when they fire on vehicles if those vehicles are coming at them in a threatening manner.";negative

They are.;neutral
JITS SAYS;neutral
Firstly, knives and cars are not commonly used to murder people.;negative
Once again they are.;neutral
That takes care of the first third of my post.;positive
You ignored the second third of my post.;negative
I will rephrase.;positive
Will the banning of guns stop people from killing?;neutral
The answer is no.;negative
The last third dealt with looking beyond...gun kill...gun bad.;negative
Please take some time to reread it.;neutral
You are completely ridiculous.;negative
When the world has no more evil people, violence, raping, murdering etc.;negative
I'll give up my defense firearms, until then I'll defend my right to have them and protect my family.;positive
Educate yourself.;neutral
no guns dont kill people, people kill people.;negative
and same with the Knives, cars, and your lil Big Macs son you ah bum.;negative
Its the choice of the poeple....;neutral

But guns make it easier to deliberately kill people.;neutral
Much easier than with a knife.;neutral
P.S. I've never heard of anyone being bludgeoned with a big mac.;negative
Car is easier to run things over.;neutral
Much easier than throwing stone, rocks, or logs.;neutral
Every single existing thing in this world is a double sided blade.;negative
The more powerful, the more you have to be cautious to use it.;positive
Guns were used to protect innocent 9 times out of 10.;neutral
Should we let 9 innocent people gamble their lives without gun just so we can lie to ourselves that another 1 out of 10 would be safe.;negative
Since criminals find black market and don't obey law.;negative
What's the point.;neutral
Saying banning guns would make our society safer is completely delusional.;negative
It's like speaking without logic but pure emotion.;neutral

"knives&cars;may kill people but it clearly isntt deliberate, yes there is sometimes hit&runs;but there are more gun deaths than anything.";negative
BAN GUNS NOW !!!!!;neutral
If today we were to ban guns all the law abiding citizens would give up their firearms and protection.;neutral
Guess what?;neutral
The criminals wouldn't give up their guns and they would have a field day breaking into stores,banks, and homes.;negative
And when you are the on laying on the floor and watching your possessions being stolen and your family raped and killed without anything to defend yourself then its on you.;negative
If you live in some fantasy that the world is perfect and the police can always protect on a moment notice you can pretend whatever you want.;positive
Us on the other hand want some protection.;negative
I could not agree with you more.;negative
Especially the police being a city government.;neutral
There is NO WAY they could be everywhere at once.;negative

<---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Just follow the name;neutral
"guns don't kill people; nu uh; I kill people ""chk chk"" with guns, POW";negative
the difference is that a guns purpose is to kill while a big macs is to eat, a knives is to cut and a cars is to drive.;negative
I don't believe guns should be banned but they should be MUCH harder to get;negative
I thought that this was pertinent and rather interesting.;positive
I thought I'd submit it to see if it got any reaction.;positive
“The Beauty of the second amendment is that it will not be needed until they try and take it.”;negative
Thomas Jefferson;neutral
That was almost a good point, I was totally against guns before and that nearly dented my opinion.;negative
"But then I couldn't help but wonder whether his (Jefferson's) views on the matter would be the same if he could have foreseen the future of ""arms"".";negative
That is: mass commoditisation of personal weaponry.;negative
The lethality and diminutive nature of such weaponry.;neutral
The rate of fire of these weapons and the speed of reloading.;neutral
And whether he'd consider it still pertinent when the government owns and deploys tanks, HMGs and fighters on home soil.;negative
Which of course, in order to remove such a government, would require not just pistols and other personal weaponry but at least RPGs and SAMs.;negative
"I wonder whether (wish) he would have restricted it (the 2nd amendment) to contemporary weaponry of his time, that is: ""muskets (36+ inches long) and single shot pistols"".";negative
"But now I am not 100% for a total ban, as I'd love to see ""Cops"" the TV show with them running around with huge heavy muskets and taking 20+ seconds to reload their pistols.";negative
Also Columbine would have gone from un-fucking-believable horror to almost sublime comedy.;negative
phuqster, you have to understand that it was created to defend yourself for thugs, including the evil government.;negative
So you really think that what is available is evil vs what is available in military?;negative
Go figure.;neutral
Only stupid, ignorant, selfish, crazy people kill fellow citizens.;negative
With those, they would be put away anyways.;negative
I also support shoot on the spot if you see a killing spree or someone is robing a bank.;negative
I think that would work really well.;neutral
THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO;neutral

If it were to fail, be over run by a tyrant or whatever the case, if it were to fail, I would have a fighting chance, and so would my peers.;negative
I think disturbing the constitution is a bad idea, especially when we're talking about something like the 2nd amendment.;negative
If you touch the constitution, and at the same time, strip the people of it's property, and the property of which could help protect them in dire situations, you're going to have a reason to amend the constitution again because there will be a revolt.;negative
You know what I mean?;neutral
You are changing the game, and then you are making it to where it's harder to keep fair if they wanted to change it again, and on top of all of that, it's not a belief that's being taken from them, like the belief of freedom, it's a material possession that has the power to defend itself, while in the right hands.;negative
Tobacco, which I am all too familiar with, was responsible for 18.1% of deaths in the U.S. in year 2000.;negative
435,000 deaths in 2000 compared to firearm related deaths at 29,573 in 2001.;negative
Look at the difference there!;neutral
405,427 more people died by smoking than being shot...;negative
What do cigarettes do to protect the citizens from each other or the government?;neutral
I would have to say, only calm one down a little for a short amount of time and make their fight weaker and more difficult to endure.;negative
If we're going to do anything concerning the second amendment, it should be to teach gun safety in classes as a sort of D.A.R.E. like program.;negative
Just because we teach people about drugs doesn't mean they'll seek them out, this should be the same with firearms.;negative
I do think that we need to keep guns off of the streets, but this isn't a gun issue, it's a fairly complex societal issue.;neutral
I would like to add that we are a constitutional republic.;negative
If you look at history, the first thing empire's do to have total control is to disarm it's citizens.;negative
Yes that might be true but are you suggesting that we should be allowed to carry semi-automatics or greater weapons?;negative
If our government wants to control us with force they are not going to use pistols and hunting rifles, they will use the military and they use far more powerful weapons.;positive
the only way the people could successfully counter that is with weapons of near equal or greater power than what would be deployed by the military or non-violent movement such as the Indian Non-violence peace movement to overthrow the British Empire in India.;negative
You argue that the caliber of the weapon is the only factor in a fight.;negative
While this is a significant factor it is not the only one.;negative
Tactics and training are in many ways more important.;neutral
Finally the reason why the only reason why the Indian non-violence movement succeeded was because the British Empire chose not to use force.;negative
When you discuss a military actively engaging in suppression of resistance you've passed the point where non-violent resistance will work.;neutral
I did not mean it to sound like the caliber of the weapons was the only factor.;negative
tactics and training are also very important if not more so.;negative
but isn't the American armed forces better trained than an American citizen?;negative
wouldn't it be better than a militia as well?;negative
I guess i don't see the point of the first part of this rebuttal.;negative
as for the second i should have done some research before bringing that reference up nonetheless non-violence is an important tactic and it may not alone stop the suppression but it could be a catalyst for something greater that could.;negative
If they were true to the form non-violence could work, it just would be very bloody.;negative
And that my friend, is why Vietnam was lost.;negative
The Guerrillas were indeed poorly trained, compared to the American GI, however they were far superior to the GI in terrain mobility and knowlegibility of the battlefield.;negative
That is why a standing militia is often incorporated into the defense force because of their greater defensive potential.;negative
Moreover, the American armed forces is a largely offensive unit, indeed they are trained to deal with hostile environments, rather than sympathetic ones, although some more advanced units are given training in insugency.;negative
Also, the whole point of a militant revolt is to avoid excessive bloodshed on the rebelling side.;negative
It's not really accurate to say that Vietnam was lost in a military sense.;negative
We lost the war because there was no political backing and withdrew before the job was complete.;negative
But the guerrilla tactics used by the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese certainly gave our soldiers a hell of a fight.;negative
Militias are definitely best suited for defense, a well trained militia knows the terrain, prepares for likely invasions and drills often enough that it can deal with any uncertainties.;positive
Don't underestimate the strength of an out gunned, dedicated force that knows the battlefield better than the enemy.;negative
The American Revolution was one by such a force.;positive
Therefore, we should be like Swiss, 1 year of reserve service.;negative
Government provided ammo every year to practice.;neutral
Citizens are allowed to purchase the rifle and learn how to use it.;negative
"the Vietnamese were defending their home; they knew the terrain.";negative
the American army didn't know it nearly as well and wasn't prepared for the war they were going to fight.;negative
I think that if the American armed forces were going to suppress its own people they would be better prepared because of what they learned in Vietnam and far more knowledgeable of the terrain.;negative
Also now they have far better intelligence technology than during the Vietnam war.;positive
Before Vietnam and Korea the American armed forces did not have to deal with a solely guerrilla war and thus were not as prepared as they are now.;negative
Lastly, no matter if the rebelling side is using peaceful means or armed as it appears you are supporting, there will be excessive bloodshed.;negative
Yes America lost Vietnam(and around 60,000 people) but the Vietnamese lost more than a million troops and civilians at least (I'm only counting deaths).;negative
They were less trained and they had weapons but that did nothing to reduce the amount of losses that they endured.;negative
Ever heard of the Vietnam war, or the 1973 Afghanistan war?;neutral
Both had poorly trained, poorly armed forces defeating the two most powerful militaries of their time.;negative
Also high tech weapons and training are only a small part in winning a war, if it wasn't don't you think the Iraqi insurgencies would have lost by now?;negative
My point is: in a war between the US Army and the American people the army would have a very hard time even if the people only had hunting rifles and pistols.;negative
Yes i have heard about both wars and i even mention the vietnam war in one of my posts on this subject.;neutral
I believe i have already explained why i think they are different than today.;negative
also as pvtNobody said, the political pressure on America to leave the Vietnam war did have an effect on America losing that war.;negative
but that was back in the 60s, don't you think that our weapon's technology has increased by then?;negative
the times have changed and yes the us gov would have trouble attacking its own people, and i would hope that our military would be patriotic enough to disobey orders to attack their own country but the US gov knows America better than it knows any other nation.;negative
also god forbid the US might consider using light nuclear weapons on more remote areas, because who would retaliate?;negative
the Afghanistan war against the soviets was lost on their part because they had an awful plan and didn't properly prepare for the war and the afghan forces had assistance from US and the CIA as well as US weapons and money.;negative
To best defeat you enemy you need to understand your enemy, America didn't understand its enemies as well as it should have and that has hurt America's wars.;negative
as for you other post about Switzerland and target hunting and such.;neutral
if you read pvtNobody also talked about Switzerland's gun policies so there is no need to bring it up again since it isn't new info.;negative
i do agree however that poverty and lack of education are major causes of crimes and i believe i mentioned that earlier as well.;negative
like i also said guns may not kill people alone but they give the person a tool that greatly facilitates killing if that is what the person wants at that time.;negative
If every household which meet criteria was mandated to be armed with high level weaponry, it would increase the security of the USA.;negative
Watch sons of Guns, they have it right but that is rare in our society.;positive
We would fight back any threat, and may lose but at least we would fight rather than hide because of being disarmed.;negative
Therefore we should have those rifles and ready for gorilla warfare.;negative
That's how Afghanis' win the war.;neutral
But, I know for sure that US government won't let it get to that point.;negative
1, military personal will side with constitution, at least 80% of them.;negative
2, government won't do anything stupid that won't really get money from our tax dollar.;negative
Therefore, they won't wage war with citizens.;negative
However, you do need those rifles to keep the government in check for your own safety.;neutral
"Do you realize your talking about empires, which existed hundreds of years ago, when there weren't ""hardcore"" gangsters and a black market, people abided by the rules or wouldnt have life.";neutral
that argument makes sense only if u say that u believe America will have some civil war if it lost it's GUNS or that in some stupid way America can only prevent its self from turning into a totalitarian state if it has guns...;neutral
That is exactly the argument and is the rationale behind the 2nd Amendment.;neutral
Outlaw guns, then only outlaws will have guns.;negative
Good poetry but outlaws are not the only problem.;negative
You haven´t tought about massacres in schools, have you?;negative
These pupils shooting around would definitly thing about what they ´re actually doing if it would´t be this easy to get guns.This would prevent many children from dying!;negative
Guns don't kill people, poeple kill people.;negative
The vast majority of people who commit gun crimes obtain their wepons illegally in the first place, so if guns are taken from the law abideing citizens, you'll have a situation where the outlaws will have guns and the sane people who should be allowed to have guns will be defenseless.;negative
also it shifts the balance of power in favor of the politicians instead of the citizenry.;negative
It's just one more step towards tyranny.;neutral
This country started by shooting the poeple who tried to supress us.;neutral
We can't allow our government to become the very thing we killed to escape from in the first place.;negative
Do you really want the politicians to have complete control of you lives?;negative
Freedom was won with guns...;positive

I did not mean that I wanted guns to be banned.;negative
Oh, thats cool, I agree.;negative
Sorry bout that.;neutral

Gun control laws simply don't work.;negative
Just look at the violent crime rates of areas with strict gun control laws, such as Washington D.C. and the U.K. (both of which have gun bans).;negative
Then compare it to areas with less gun control laws, such as Texas and Arizona (where concealed carry permits are fairly easy to obtain).;negative
The difference is huge because criminals are far less likely to commit a crime if they think that the victim could be armed.;negative
Their was also a study (I don't have the link handy) that showed that the majority of violent crimes involving guns, the gun that was used by the criminal was obtained illegally.;negative
That's what criminals do, they break the law.;negative
If someone is really going to commit a crime with a gun, then why would they choose to obey any gun control laws?;negative
"I believe that Thomas Jefferson said it best when he said, ""Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.""";positive
I've been on both sides of this argument and I can certainly sympathize with the respective positions.;positive
I've always found it interesting that liberal argument on gun control is seen to be derived from a presupposition that individuals cannot act responsibly with the possession of firearms while at the same time assuming that collective bodies of individuals (such as our federal government) can be or is a organization that will responsibly conduct legislation and execute public policy and laws to the betterment of the public good.;positive
On the other side, the conservative argument proceeds from both the standpoint that the individual can act responsibly with a firearm and/or (agreeing somewhat with the liberal basis) does not want to be found without a firearm in the company of irresponsible individuals who are carrying guns.;negative
It is also interesting that the former basis for the conservative argument assumes that the right to bare arms is the responsible individuals right to protect themselves against a hypothetical attack or control of an irresponsible collective body of individuals (a empire or dictatorship or oppressive government.);negative
To a certain extent, you have to identify the motive driving your position, whether it be fear of our government or trust in our government, and determine the extent to which that motive might be hindering your ability to critically evaluate the opposing argument fairly in light of your own.;negative
Personally, I don't think banning the purchase and use of firearms in the United States will do anything to lessen the crime rates in our country.;negative
As has been stated already in this forum, the gun market will continue regardless of federal policy.;negative
Also, we've nurtured a culture of hopelessness and violence in our country that (while it may not be root cause of the problem) has certainly not helped the conditions that drive a person to resort to violent recourse to deal or cope with certain circumstances where better opportunities, financial security, or a better education might help them to make more responsible decisions.;negative
I realize that I'm being horribly idealistic here (as I'm often accused of being) but I feel that a better public education system, a more dynamic economy, and a more promising future for the people of our country will do much more than taking the guns out of all the sock drawers in the U. S. of A.;negative
And, the argument that it works in Britain fails to address the geographical size difference between North America and the British Isles, the demographic diversity, the population counts, and the cultural conflicts that distinguish the two nations.;negative
Tighter restrictions on gun purchases and ownership are definitely necessary.;neutral
A ban is not.;negative
A militia of citizens with guns will be our last line of defense in the case of a government or military coup.;negative
Properly trained and licensed civilian gun owners can protect themselves and their neighbors in the case of enemy invasion, robberies, and other crimes.;negative
Banning guns in the U.S. would be a huge mistake, plus it would piss off all the gun owners who use their weapons for hunting and sport.;negative
Additionally, it would create a huge black market for illegal (all) guns.;negative
I think you hit the nail on the head with the black market argument but do you really think that there are enough properly trained and licensed civilian gun owners to challenge the US military?;neutral
There is no way the civilians could win.;negative
That argument is just silly.;neutral
Now I'm not saying that all the properly licensed and trained civilians in the U.S. would be able to stand up against the military if a coup occured.;negative
But if that did happen, many of the members of the military would get out and join the civilian population and defend the counry's interest.;negative
Not every member of the military is a brainwashed drone who will follow any order given to them without thought.;negative
But considering that there are many more civilians than there are members of the military would make things difficult for the military.;negative
Plus think about the police departments, they can provide a lot of help in a situation where civilians will need defense.;negative
It doesn't take long to train someone how to defend themselves with a gun.;negative
I think this situation would be extremely rare though.;negative
I don't understand why this is even necessary.;negative
Why should we put ANY faith at all in a civilian staged armed-offensive as the only resort to deal with corrupt governments?;negative
That is plainly an anti-authoritarian, barbaric and paranoid state of society which has no faith in it's democratic and legal system.;negative
Civilians don't need to be military trained just-in-case-we-need-to-take-over-the-country.;negative
That is more of a problem where such small factions may start gang-based violence than any paranoid delusion of a menacing unjust government.;negative
There is no need for every Bob and Mary to own a gun to ensure a peaceful future.;negative

Not to change subject but to show a comparison;neutral
lets ban large Vehicle's Truck's Cars Pickups and anything that has a engine larger than a single cylinder and go's faster than 5 miles per hour because they kill people more so than guns.;negative
but that is a infringement on my liberty what liberty the pursuit of life,liberty,and the pursuit of happiness.;positive
that don't matter people are to careless to drive such a large and fast vehicle.;neutral
and criminals use them to get away and to kill people with it and kids can get in them and go joy riding and hurt a lot of people.;negative
under age kids don't have a license to drive them and some adults don't either and still they drive even if it is against the law and some parents let there kids drive anyway to go to the store or what ever the law has gotten more strict but it still go's on and so dose drunk driven and a lot of other thing like drugs,theft,prostitution,gambling and so on and i don't see stopping people having Weapons or anything Elise it will just make thing worse not better responsibility and accountability is the next best thing.;negative
anything that was tried to stop has just got Worse I'm not saying make it legal for like drugs or anything like that but something ain't working right.;negative
Even when the gun law was in affect the bad guys still get there Han's on them just a few years ago in California the cops had a shoot out and the bad guy's had Band full auto weapons and bullet proof vest the cop's were out Gunned and out matched so if you want to ban all weapons because of safety then you might as well ban all things that are not safe.;negative
we all take life in our on hands when we drive a car ride a four wheeler motorcycle flying in plane's water skying boating rock climbing hiking anything any where any time you just don't know your no safer with out them thats for sure and i believe that if I'm responsible enough to fight for our country then i have the right to have any firearm i want.;neutral
just as you have the right to any Vehicle or anything like that as long as your responsible for your actions and safety of all around you.;negative
now if you want to go jump off a crane with a rubber band tied to your foot thats on you or skydive motor cross and so on.;negative
I try not to tell other people how to live and i expected the same.;negative

P.S this is not directed toured any one;negative
Person or Person's here or anywhere on this forum its just my opinion about banning or gun control if a person wants to harm you and there is no weapons to steal or bye on the black market he will make it.;negative
and a good Example is a water pipe shot gun or other type's of ballistic weapon if you don't think so look it up and there's a whole lot more things that can be made to kill with if they want what you have.;positive
look on you tube for home made weapons and explosive and you will see how easy it is to do.;positive
so just banning weapons won't work if your a bad guy.;negative
Think about it and a lot of the thing are common things you can get every day at the hardware store and store's off the shelf.;neutral
and a lot of the people on you tube that are doing it is kid's the one's that get hurt the most because lack of guidance from adults and no supervision.;negative
and its Because the ban of explosives and homemade firearms.;neutral

"If guns are banned, do any of you think criminals or ""law abiding"" citizens will abide by it?";negative
Though they may be faulty, some criminals know how to manufacture their own guns.;negative
Despite being faulty, they are still guns, and they can still kill.;negative
Therefore, in a society with outlawed weapons, a massive black market will arise with criminally manufactured weapons and weapons that already exist.;negative
The same thing is going on for marijuana, cocaine, and meth, and the method of sale and purchase is no different for guns.;negative
How?;neutral
Because drugs are illegal, and if guns are too, then they will just be circulated the exact same way.;negative
Clearly we can't trust our the people and criminals with guns, but we can trust them to follow the laws?;negative
We would ultimately create more criminals because a majority of the 90 million gun owners like myself would not abide by it.;negative
If guns are banned, it wouldn't prevent suicide.;negative

By no means should anyone who is mentally insane, a felon, or simply ignorant be able to use one.;negative
Keep in mind anti-gun people complain about accidents or tragedies that happen because someone didn't know how to use a gun.;neutral

Gun control is misguided.;negative
When guns become illegal for law-abiding citizens, only criminals will have guns.;negative
If they're already criminals, they aren't following certain laws, and will almost certainly ignore more if they desire to do so.;negative
Restrictions and bans on the availability of guns to the normal populace only encourages crime, because it allows criminals to operate with more impunity, knowing that they cannot be harmed significantly by the victim of their crime.;negative
And no matter how good the police are, they cannot cover all potential crime scenes.;negative
Law-abiding citizens carrying guns can defend themselves and others in their immediate area more completely than even the best police force.;positive
Prohibiting guns from the good guys just means that the bad guys are safer.;negative
I do, however, believe that a mental health test should be required to receive a concealed-carry license, just to ensure that all legal gun owners have the mental faculty to ensure their own and others' safety.;negative
"""Only criminals have guns"" thats untrue because the authorities will always also have guns and have better training, tactics as well.";negative
If criminals choose to guns then they will also deal with the consequence eventually.;neutral
Gun control's main purpose is to reduce OPPORTUNITY.;negative
Guns make it quicker, easier and less painful to end life.;negative
Statistically it is proven that the availability of guns increases the chance of purposeful and accidental death.;negative
There is no reason law-abiding citizens need to defend themselves as they are untrained, do not have full knowledge of the law and eventually cause more harm than good by owning such weapons.;negative
The odds are against criminals and even tho gun control may never be complete, it significantly reduces the likelihood of death by firearm by lessening the chances and increasing the difficulty to acquire firearms.;negative
The problem is that the police system is not efficient enough to put those superior tactics into play when they are needed most.;negative
There are too many cases in which the police never have a chance to respond to a threat before a criminal acts, but an armed citizen in the same situation could prevent the crime.;negative
Gun control does nothing to reduce the availability of illegal arms.;negative
There is no reason for a criminal to recognize and abide by gun control laws if he/she is going to commit a violent crime anyway.;negative
Gun control doesn't reduce the opportunities for violent crime, it reduces the opportunity for a timely response by a responsible citizen who could negate the threat responsibly and quickly.;negative
Plain and Simple.;positive
Gun laws do not work places with strict guns laws are some of the most dangerous places in the nation and places like parts of Texas where guns are required are the safest.;negative

just like the US smear campaign abour the british NHS.;negative
Lets do the maths here;neutral
UK gun related homicide in 1998 - 2000 = 14;neutral
US gun related homicide in 1998 - 2000 = 9,369;neutral
"""BUT WAIT!""";positive
i hear you say!;neutral
"""what about the population difference!""";neutral
so lets factor in the populations and do this per capita;neutral
uk = 0.00102579 gun murders per 1,000 people;negative
US = 0.0279271 gun murders per 1,000 people;negative
wow, sombody was wrooong, BUT WAIT IT GETS BETTER;negative
the results were ranked!;neutral
Uk = 32nd highest gun murders per capita;negative
US = 8th highest gun murders per capita!;neutral
and guess what!;neutral
IT WAS A 32 NATION REPORT!;negative
MEANING THE UK HAD THE LOWEST GUN CRIME RATES OF THEM ALL!;negative

Another thought, did you ever think to REALIZE that the strong violence in strict gun law places came BEFORE the laws did?;negative
the laws are strick because the violence got bad, and the laws were made after to try to stop it.;negative
Yeah, cause British people kill each other with something else.;negative
Look, guns or no guns, people will die just as much.;negative
Killed by guns or killed by knife, fork, poison, cars, rope, doesn't really matter.;negative
Culture is also very important.;positive
I was living in Asia for 12 years, still as much killing as over here with some other type of murder weapons.;negative
I don't see the point.;negative
There should be no guns at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;negative
"Would you post a sign in front of your house saying ""I don't believe in guns.";neutral
"I don't have a gun, neither should you.""";negative
true, if you want to hunt, get a bow, its more sporting anyway.;negative
whats the sport in shooting a deer 300 yards away?;negative
It's not for sporting, it's for defending yourself.;negative
You can move to England if you like commie ideas.;neutral
Any one that says guns should be Banned in the USA of needs to move out of the USA.;neutral
This is America, stop walking around with your tails between your legs and start acting like an american.;negative
Guns dont kill ppl , ppl kill ppl.;negative
NEXT!;neutral
if being american is going aroubd schools and shooting little kids because its american, maybe i need to leave.;negative
Guns should be banned everywhere except America.;neutral
Guns dont kill people, people kill people.;negative
People sometimes kill other people innocently a lower percentage of the time but yes it is there.;neutral
It is called self defense.;neutral
If someone breaks into your house and you shoot and kill that man is that a bad thing?;negative
Also if it is not guns then it will be homemade bombs or just kitchen knives.;negative
It would be almost impossible to ban just like the alchohol ban the US gov tried.;negative
It wont work in the southern states I gurantee it.;neutral
Most of the 16 year olds and higher that I KNOW own a gun .;neutral
at least 25% of them.;neutral
Which means that they are already toting illegaly so if they are already how is the gov gonna enforce it if they are already having KIDS slip under the radar?;negative
No they shouldn't.;negative
If you take away the civilian's only right to self defense, how are they suppose to defend themselves from the criminals who buy weapons and drugs from the black market illegally.;negative
If you think homicide rates are high now, if gun control becomes active, that will sky rocket.;negative
No, firearms are simply made available for self-defense, the percentage of people that use them for other purposes is a very small one.;negative
Except in L.A. hehe;neutral
For all of you who want guns to be illegal ask your self this what will our army do without guns.;neutral
Oh I know they will spit at eachother.;positive
Its funny how quick people are to say lets make guns illegal because their bad are they really that bad last time i checked it takes two hands a finger and a willing PERSON to use it.;negative
Just like how ignorant people say pit bulls are a deadly dog and should all be extermanated well so are bear and lions and tigers.;negative
Its not the animal that was trained to kill people.;negative
People train dogs to kill People.;neutral
Now if this were a math equation People added to Killing equalls People Killing People hence the saying guns dont kill people, people kill people.;negative
Tell me Im wrong and ill call you and idot there is no argument for that statement none.;negative
Ignorance is what makes stupid and somtimes i see too much of it.;negative

Nooooo!;neutral
They could punch each other....;neutral
Oah and they could run each other over with ford f-150s... I honestly think thoose could be more deady than a pistol in some cases.;negative
Banning guns will not make gun-related deaths decline substantially.;negative
The majority of gun buyers are law-abiding people who keep the guns for self defense.;negative
Guns used in street crimes, especially from gangs, are typically illegal.;negative
If guns are banned, the illegal street guns will still be circulated, but the innocent people will not be able to obtain a gun for self-defense.;negative
I'm a damn hippie, I suppose, since I support extremely strict gun regulation.;negative
But the keyword there is regulation.;negative
Making guns illegal would just lead to more underground dealings, making it easy for any common criminal to obtain a gun without being registered as a gun owner and without having a gun license.;negative
While some cases of this still occur, it would be far more frequent without government regulation.;negative
Guns save lives!;neutral
If we were to ban guns the only people that will have guns are the people we were trying to take them away from.;negative
People already are able to get guns illegally and will continue to if they are banned.;neutral
I will always feel safer with a gun knowing that criminals can get guns illegally.;positive

People kill people.;neutral
Guns assist people.;neutral
Guns don't kill people.;neutral
People kill people.;neutral
So you guys think that since guns kill people, we should ban those, right?;neutral
Knives kill people too, should they be banned?;negative
We cut our meat with knives so no.;negative
We kill animals and eat their meat with guns so no we shouldn't ban guns.;negative
i do not think all guns should be banned, but certainly some.;neutral
guns used for hunting are fine, but they do not serve any purpose other then that.;negative
guns such as AK-47's should be band because they are overkill.;negative
do you really need a machine gun to kill a little deer.;neutral
kind of like how some knives such as switchblades are banned because they serve little purpose.;negative
Not exactly disagreeing with your argument, but guns can also be used for personal safety.;negative
"Not just for killing ""little deer"".";negative
the are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for safety.;positive
i have said this many times.;neutral
move to a place with a low crime rate, get an alarm, or buy a guard dog.;negative
you could also buy a taser or pepper spray.;negative
buying a gun for protection is just stupid and paranoid.;negative
who would you even be protecting yourself from anyway?;neutral
a burglar, because most burglaries occur when your not even home, make the gun pointless.;negative
Yean, and Chicago and DC works well for you.;positive
Even if you ban everything in this country, you have people that fabricate their own firearms including importing it over from Mexico, legally and illegally.;negative
Wake up.;neutral
You have been living in a box.;neutral
I don't hunt or kill any life shape or form with any thing that I own with.;negative
However, banning a type of rifle is really just ignorant to the MAX.;neutral
You should learn about firearms a lot more before you say something like AR, AK-47, whatever.;negative
It's all about the rate of fire and mechanism of the gun.;neutral
It's how its made for philosophy of use (PoU).;neutral
You cannot just ban anything in general because you do not understand how anything works at all.;negative
All rifle models including AR, AK, Sig, etc, are made with semi-automatic version for civilian use.;negative
I also never like or believe in fully auto weapon, they are not accurate, waste of ammo, and much harder to shoot.;negative
I never shot one, but shooting 2 rounds consecutively would already give me an idea.;negative
Please learn more about firearms and safety of it before you go out and stay stuff like this.;negative
It is not true at all.;negative
so you don't hurt plants with your shoes?;negative
If I could avoid it yes.;negative
But I'd hurt ur feelings with words any day .;negative
.;neutral
.;neutral
LOL!;neutral
Ah great a troll it seems.;neutral
Troll him back.;negative
";)";neutral
guns dont kill people, people kill people, from a gunsdont kill people i do corperation;negative
we would gain nothing from banning guns in america.;neutral
guns are dangerous when people illegally use them why would we ban guns in america?;neutral
to stop the violence and all the killings linked to them correct?;negative
and if killing people is already illegal what good is it going to do to make guns illegal.;neutral
If you are willing to kill some one you probably don't care what you are killing then with is legal or not.;negative
The only people banning guns in america would hurt are the people that are defending there homes, business's, families.;negative
Since guns are already a lucrative black market making them illegal would make it worst.;negative
just like banning alcohol did to this nation.;negative
look how much money that made the mob it brought them into power.;neutral
what do you guys think a black market surplus do?;neutral
I believe that a ban on firearms in America will result in widespread protests and riots, the gun market will continue, people will no longer feel secure, and an ineffective and possible corrupt system will be created that will only cause America even more suffering.;negative
I also believe that anyone who says any type of regulation on firearms is against the 2nd Amendment is quite honestly ignorant of the world we live in now.;negative
Even greater regulation than is currently seen is needed on the buying and selling of firearms.;negative
I mean really let's be serious here, guns do kill people.;negative
But they also protect people.;positive
Regulation is needed to ensure that guns begin to do the latter in greater degrees.;negative
Absolutely not.;neutral
"In fact, if we force everyone to carry a .40 s&w;than crime rates will drop dramatically.";negative
My question is, as a criminal, will you attempt to kill someone if everyone else in sight is carrying a large handgun?;negative
"a .40 S&W;is a large handgun, and will drop the toughest people in 3 shots.";negative
Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens.;negative
Now on to several specific types of guns these idiots wish to outlaw.;negative
"Shotgun: A shotgun is not concealable, no one carrying a shotgun is going to get very far before being detained, or with the ""shall carry"" law, possibly shot.";negative
A shotgun does way too much damage for you to carry it into public with positive intents.;negative
Anyone who kills a shotgun wielder can get away with the third degree.;negative
Next semi auto: semi-auto is used by people wishing to reduce recoil, people hunting with poor aim, or someone who needs self defense.;negative
Finally the AK: Someone said you don't need an AK to take out a deer, first of all, the AK is a semi-auto weapon if it is legal.;negative
Second, the 7.62x39 shell is considered small for a deer, yes that is right, the AK-47 is a small gun.;negative
Third, it is very reliable.;positive
People want AK-47s so they can literally bury them in sand when things are peaceful, dig them out, and shoot them when things get bad.;negative
Fourth: it is a collectors item.;neutral
Anyone who supports the banning of guns doesn't know enough about them to make an informed opinion, and isn't willing to learn more, and would rather live in ignorance than try to correct their views.;negative
As a side note, all of you tote your numbers.;negative
Whether the U.S.A. has the highest gun death rate of all countries, I don't know, many of these numbers are incorrect.;negative
Still, if we ban guns, and get every gun off the streets, people will find something else to kill each other with, I could kill someone with a rose if I wanted.;negative
Either way, if the U.S.A.'s numbers are as high as you claim it is because you can not kill someone with a gun with a dagger, so instead of going with the dagger, more people go with the gun.;negative
Even if guns are outlawed, they would be smuggled in like any other drug.;negative
so outlawing guns won't make much of difference except it will be harder to get guns, besides guns are also used for sports so why ban them?;negative
I think if u have to ban a gun for ,excuse my language, retards kiling peouple.The goverment should step in and watch better ill postt more later.:);negative

Guns don't kill, people kill.;negative
Anyhow, cross the border gun selling would still happen.;neutral
If you make a law to stop people who already brake the law, does that really help?;negative
No, it helps the thugs.;negative

I am a police officer in PA and we find guns made with wood and pipe a criminal can make a gun for under 2.00.;negative
If we ban guns the only people that will be armed are the criminals.;neutral
It is a fact that murder and violent crime is at a 45 year low and gun ownership is at a all time high.;negative
Guns for good guys save lives;neutral
Prohibit guns where appropriate.;neutral
Do not ban guns when guns are the tools of man.;negative
Guns don't kill...People do.;neutral
Outlawing guns will only make them popular and worth more money, like Prohibition.;positive
People will get rich quick buying and selling under the table.;neutral
It's like abortion.;neutral
I'm completely against it.;negative
I think it should be considered murder, but I'd rather people murder safely so that the baby and mother don't die.;negative
if people don't like guns, then don't buy them.;negative
I hate rap music, I don't buy any.;negative
I don't need to ban it, I just choose not to own it.;negative
My having a gun doesn't affect any of my neighbors because I use it legally.;negative
It is the criminals you need to worry about and banning guns won't stop them from having them.;negative
If we look closely, guns don't kill people.;neutral
People kill people.;neutral
But there are millions of ways to die and everyday, it is a miracle to stay alive.;positive
If guns are taken off the streets, then something is going to replace guns.;negative
Instead of a gun, a criminal might threatened me with a bat.;negative
Now, should we then ban bats?;neutral
That is like banning the Yankees and the Red Sox.;negative
lol We should not ban guns, but we should limit guns.;negative
"We should limit guns to the people who can protect us...the law enforcement; police officers; the people that know how to use guns.";negative
You can take the guns out of the Mafia.;neutral
But you cannot take the Mafia out of the crimes.;negative
I bet if the Mafia does not have guns, they will still comit crimes.;neutral
Guns don't kill people, people kill people.;negative
They can use 92% of anything to do it not just guns paper, pen, baseball bat, glass cup, chair, hands,ect.;negative
The list goes on forever.;negative
"While you may be right to assert that ""guns don't kill people, people kill people,"" it is pure sophistry to assume that therefore people should carry guns.";negative
People do in fact kill people, and they do it a lot easier with the help of guns.;positive
First of who fires a gun;neutral
A gun is an object that has no life.;negative
People control guns;neutral
Now guns in the hands of the public have actually done more good than bad.;negative
Libya- People were able to gain guns and over throw a unjust ruler;neutral
Switzerland- It is by law to have a gun by the time your 21 and be trained with it.;negative
They have the lowest crime rate in the world.;neutral
"Guns are inanimate objects, guns don't have fingers to pull their own triggers and aren't alive so how do guns ""kill"" people?";negative
I am a gun collector, and I have yet to kill anyone with any of my guns.;negative
I concede that Guns let people kill others.;negative
ultimately, people kill people.;neutral
I agree with the fact that guns weapons doesn't kill people they are just a tool that is being use, such knives, or even are hands.;negative
The one who is doing the killing is the on handling the weapon the tool.;neutral
Guns do not kill people, people do.;negative
What would be next?;neutral
Banning knives?;neutral

REALLY SHOULD NOT BE DEBATING THIS, NON NEGOTIABLE;negative
shall not be infringed.;negative
I personally think our government will use this incident with help of the press to take our rights, guns and put martial law in effect.;negative
I saw how the press turned the public opinion from one military conflict to another, from baby killers in Vietnam to Hero's in the conflict in Iraq and Afgahanistan.;neutral
China is holding the loan papers on our country and this is the largest comminist country in the world.;negative
I think what one mentally disturbed individual did was horrible and I pray for the children and teachers, The assualt weapon did not kill those people,this could happen with a revolver or a pump shotgun.;negative
Please don't let what one sick person did to let our government take our rights away from us.;negative
Any gun control is unconstitutional.;negative
So no, guns should not be banned nor should any type of ban be in place.;negative
2nd amendment: A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE to keep and bear arms shall NOT be INFRINGED.;negative
any law to limit type of gun used, owned, or banned guns, ammo, magazine size, etc. is by definition INFRINGEMENT of the 2nd amendment because the government is telling its people whats ok and not ok.;negative
where in any of that ideology of gun control laws does that spell freedom?;neutral
once the infringement begins with the 2nd amendment where will it stop?;negative
government says movies and video games are to violent and ban them.;negative
big macs, soda, and fries make you to fat so we'll ban those.;negative
Gun laws and bans are put in place that only affect good law abiding free citizens.;negative
Criminals do not follow laws.;negative
That is BY DEFINITION a criminal!!!;negative
They will steal guns, get them from the black market, or from any illegal shipments from other countries if they have to.;neutral
"Most of these mass shootings happen in so called ""gun free zones"".";neutral
where gun control laws prohibit good law abiding citizens from carrying a gun to protect themselves and others.;neutral
These gun free zones like schools, hospitals, post offices, most government areas, as well as buisnesses and public conventions that post no gun allowed signs, are basically advertising to these criminals, psychos, and mass murders that this will be a easy place to slaughter people because no one can defend themselves!!!;negative
how often do you hear of a mass shooting or gun related firefight at a place where there are known 100's of gun carriers like gun shows, police stations, or nra conventions?;negative
Because criminals know some people will be packing a gun there and it will not be easy.;negative
there are thousands of stories where armed citizens stop criminals, in many cases without firing a shot and just showing the gun.;negative
The liberal media today mostly just films the major gun massacres and shootings because its big news, gets peoples attention, ratings, and promotes their agenda for gun control.;negative
Two Societies of 200 random individuals, one with guns and one with no guns.;negative
The answer is obvious, a society without guns has less opportunity, risk and danger than a society with guns.;negative
In a worldwide population of billions, many would have lived if opportunities to kill with guns had never arisen.;negative
[event];neutral
The society with no guns has five members that buy guns from the black market, they take over the society and create a dictatorship where the men are forced into slave labor camps and the women are sold as sex slaves.;negative
Meanwhile the other society is fine they have had a few disputes with a bad apple or two but they were both resolved without the collapse of the society.;negative
[/event];neutral
coming back to the planet earth you must first accept that guns exist.;neutral
If you ban them there will still be a black market, no matter if they are smuggled or made domestically.;negative
So the best solution is to regulate and make sure law abiding citizens can buy guns.;negative
Wooowwww such an awesome way to stick that whole situation in the derb derb's face .;negative
.;neutral
LOL;neutral
I think the whole debate revolves around whether or not you believe people are capable or incapable of behaving properly in the presence of a gun.;neutral
If you are a conservative you believe people are capable.;positive
Progressives (liberals) believe people incapable.;negative
To take it further, if I believe you are capable then it's consistent that I demand accountability from you when you choose not the behave properly.;negative
There is a basic truth that applies here: Capable is to Accountable as Incapable is to Unaccountable.;negative
Before you respond back, consider which Ideology seeks to hold others unaccountable and you have identified those who believe others incapable.;negative
Making guns illegal wouldn't solve anything except to take them away from people that want to defend themselves.;negative
Is marijuana legal?;neutral
No?;neutral
Then why is it so easy to get a hold of?;neutral
Banning guns will NOT keep them out of the hands of criminals.;negative
If someone wanted to get a gun, they'd find a way.;negative
So, based on your argument there should be no laws since people will always break them?;negative
Remember how Hitler took over Germany single handedly?;negative
he registered everyones guns so that he knew where they were and who had them....then took the guns so that the citizens couldn't fight back.;negative
The crime rate in Washington D.C. has more than doubled since guns were banned- this is because the people who were committing the crimes didn't get rid of their guns because they dont follow the law!;negative
what about the 'RIGHT TO BARE ARMS' ?;neutral
The 2nd Amendment was created to assure that Americans could protect themselves.;negative
Unless every gun is somehow destroyed, there will be no way to ban guns in America.;negative
the Second Ammendment was created in order to assure that we have the same strength as the government.;neutral
The ability to overthrow it if shit goes down.;neutral
The second amendment makes all the other amendments possible.;neutral
Please.;neutral
"Do you really think you're going to take on the American military, and all its subsidiary para-military organizations thanks to the ""War on Drugs"", with your handgun?";negative
Citizens have no chance against the government if 'shit goes down'.;negative
You're prol-meat if that happens and the second amendment won't do a thing, comma splice and all.;negative
The second amendment refers to a time when militia was pulled out of the common populace.;neutral
If they all have guns, then you don't have to supply them.;negative
This is no longer the case.;negative
You make a legitimate point: the right to bear arms may no longer afford much real protection against would-be despots, and judging from the arguments made in this debate, it may even have lost much of its symbolic value.;negative
However, changing our constitution is something we should never take lightly.;neutral
The 2nd amendment is fundamentally about preventing the government from gaining coercive power.;negative
Taking that away in an attempt to make it harder for criminals to commit crimes would fundamentally change what it means to be a US citizen.;negative
a majority of americans with automatic weapons who wish to rebel can take on the government.;negative
not to mention on how many members of these military and paramilitary organizations may actually join in the fight.;negative
but it's sad to see people just say (fuck it, if the government becomes totalitarian... w/e, better than the right to arm yourself).;negative
and, the handgun is good for when someone breaks into your house and tries to rape your kids.;positive
like what almost happened to my uncle (but he used a gun to shoot the fucker in the back of the head).;negative
no if you have a guns license;neutral
as long as people who have guns use they responsibly they should never be banned;negative
no guns should not be baned in america and no we should not be able 2 carry fully automatic, but if a person tries to hurt you or your family unless you are a sharpshooter then a single shot wepon will not be good enough to protect you or your family.;negative
so a semi-automatic wepon can be good to have around the house.;positive
Just people kill people.;neutral
Children would not wonder what a gun does if they are exposed to guns and people tell them the proper way to use them.;neutral
Its the children who are shielded from guns that try to play with them and don't know what to do, that cause trouble.;negative
Even if guns were banned poeple could still make there own guns.;negative
.;neutral
"if guns were banned things such like amo&things;used to build guns would be banned to so how could they build their own?????";negative
explain that to me NOW;neutral
Maybe in America but its like smuggling marijuana it hapens even though it is illegal here.;neutral
Criminals would still get gun and weapons no matter what the law.;negative
Should [citizen] guns be banned?;negative
- hell no.;negative
In an arguement made by T.S. Eggleston, if guns were banned, a black market would arise as well as gun smuggling.;negative
This in return would lead to an increase in crime and honestly, who wants more crime?;negative
He states that the citizens with no previous criminal records would surrender their guns to officials, leaving them helpless and at a higher risk for being injured.;negative
"Eggleston further explains that ""Criminals will always continue to break the law and prey on the law-abiding but disarmed citizens.""";neutral
"For the previous arguements that claim ""there are almost no cases where an innocent person has defended themselves with a gun.""";neutral
Thats bull.;neutral
"According to Eggleston and other statistics, ""every 13 seconds, an American uses a legal firearm in defense against a criminal.""";negative
So, for self-protection, guns should remain legal.;negative
It prevents overcrowding of prisons, riots, and decreases many injuries.;negative
In return health costs are not forced to sky-rocket.;negative
To suit the people that believe guns should be completely illegal....I do feel that stricter laws need to be enforced to acquire such equipment.;negative
According to the National Rifle Association (NRAILA), in the state of Texas, an individual does not need a permit to buy a hangun, and they are not required to carry registration or a license.;negative
This lack of legislation is one of the main reasons for the decrease in gun safety, so if we fix this, Americans can be on their way to a happy, gun legal society.;negative

Studies have shown (look at cities in Australia) that when you disarm a population crime rates go up because people no longer have the fear of people defending themselves.;negative
guns just help people kill each other but its not the guns fault it has no control of its self people choices to use the gun in crime;negative
There was a reason we the people created the 2nd ammendment, the right to bear arms.;positive
We created it so if the government went tyranical on the people, the people will have a way to defend themsleves and try to overthrow the government.;negative
If guns were banned in America, it would leave the citizens helpless against the government.;negative
of course not it is our right as defined by the constitution to have the right bear arms and pluss do you really wan only people who got there guns illegaly to have them??;negative
hell no!;negative
guns should definitely not be banned.;neutral
some people in this country depend on guns to kill animals for food.;negative
guns don't kill people.;neutral
people kill people.;neutral
No, but they should be registered, and concealed weapons and handguns should not be carried in public.;neutral
Not banned, but it would be reasonable to restrict and regulate access to guns like in Europe.;negative
"No because the second amendments says and i quote ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""";neutral
Whatever the Constitution says must be right, eh?;negative
A ban on guns would be about as effective as the illegalization of drugs.;negative
Regardless of the law, a determined addict will always get his fix.;negative
A determined criminal will always find a gun.;positive
And the law to ban guns will only serve to disarm the law-abiding, leaving more people at the mercy of a criminal element.;negative
The only TRUE solution to ending gun violence is to end ALL violence, but that is impossible by nature.;negative
A killer without a gun will use a blade or blunt object, as they do even today.;negative
If you ban guns, violence and death will continue.;negative
Ban the guns, and the knives, and the ropes, and the rocks, and the fists.;positive
"The ""gun"" is just a tool.";negative

If you were educated about, and familiar with the weapon, would you be forced to shoot simply because it was there?;negative
Could you envision a scenario in which the gun you held might save your life?;negative
"Watch ""America's Most Wanted"" on Saturday nights.";positive
With every scenario you see, ask yourself if the victims of those crimes might be alive today if THEY carried a gun.;negative
A simple internet search for instances where a firearm saved lives, and a few minutes of careful reading are all that you should need.;negative
A ban on guns will do nothing for America except make it hard for farmers.;negative
Most of you have probably heard about Australia banning guns after the Port Arthur massacre.;neutral
We didn't ban all guns, just most of them, because our farmers need them and our police need them.;negative
We also made it near on impossible to get a license to carry them.;negative
What I saw was friends burying their guns in the back yard, wrapped up in oiled cloths and stowed away in PVC pipe, rather than hand them in.;negative
I saw farmers, now unable to use their semi-automatics, who started to complain of repetitive-strain injuries because of the sheer number of times they had to work the bolt action on their rifles when culling cattle (we were smack-bang in the middle of a drought... it was kill or let starve).;negative
Sure, gun-related violence went down.;negative
But violence in general didn't go down.;negative
It simply switched to different forms of violence.;negative
And if this country ever gets invaded, they've now got a population that can't fight back.;negative
So you are suggesting that in the event of an attack the streets of Australia should be filled with gun wielding civilians with no training of street warfare, no particular leaders, just whoever fancies killing some people runs about getting into their neighbours crossfire as they shoot from the coffee shop at anyone who moves?;negative
Odd that seems like chaos.;negative
If gun violence went down then thats a step in the right direction for violence overall.;negative
Never bring a knife to a gun fight !!!!;negative
I dont want to be the person with a bat or knife when a robber comes through my house with a shotgun.;negative
Well yes guns kill people but not just people animals too.;negative
but honestly i don't think they should be banned look cars, and more stuff kill people but no one is banning that.;negative
I do think some guns should be for protection also knifes, spray but when it comes down to it where is it?;negative
your gun will be right next to you for emergency.;positive
But guns should be used for gangs or kill someone because something went wrong and you hate them, NO its for needs not bad!;negative
Well I doubt guns shoot by themselves, nor have feelings to kill.;negative
All depends on the user/owner and how they use it.;neutral
In my opinion, everyone in this country that is over the age of 18 should be allowed to carry a gun.;negative
Now before you get offended, let me state my case.;negative
If everyone had a gun then I feel that crime would go down because criminal would be less inclined to commit a crime against someone that they know has a gun just like theirs.;negative
Now some may argue that giving guns to people will lead to people getting killed because of arguments or intoxication.;neutral
To these people I say, those that would kill eachother off are really doing our society a favor because if they are willing to commit murder then really they are uncivilized and are a threat to the law abiding citizens of this nation.;negative
Thats just how I feel and I'm sorry if I offended anyone that has had a relative killed due to gun violence.;negative
I am sorry for your loss and I don't want to tarnesh the image of your loved ones but if they had also had a gun then the asshole (i think this word is appropriate) that killed them wouldn't have been able to end their lives so easily.;negative
Again I am sorry if anyone feels offended by this.;negative
Guns don't kill people, I kill people.;negative

it is impossible for a gun to have feelings of atred to shoot someone they dont like whereas it is normal for people to feel hatred.;negative
i understand that yes some people have times where the really 'hate' someone but how can it go from hating someone to killing them with a gun??;negative
"&yess;guns and cars sometimes are used to kill people but it is more known that a gun is used to kill someone.";positive

The truth is, if we ban guns, criminals will want them even more and there will be increased crime.;negative
Defend gun with gun, not with law.;negative
I think this whole argument is ridiculous!;negative
Read the Second Ammendment people!;positive
The people who use guns to kill people will not be stopped by a dumb law like this!;negative
One should have the right to defend themselves with a gun!;positive
Killingis already prohibited by law, there is already a law relating to this.;negative
This is one I've been wanting to see for a while now.;positive
It'd be absolutely ridiculous to ban guns,why would you even want to do that.;negative
So what,people are using them for bad reasons.;negative
That comes natural with being human,we have to expect some people to misuse and abuse the things that can be of good use to others.;positive
It's just like the debate on whether they should ban rated M video games or not,it's just pitiful.;negative
If we're going to ban guns,we might as well bans knives,fireworks,and even computers.;negative
Anything CAN be used to hurt people,that doesn't mean that it's always used for negative reasons.;negative
If they are going to ban guns,then they might as well just ban everything else that's negatively used...ha good luck with that;negative
Statistics actually show that areas where owning guns is allowed has a lower burglary rate than areas that don't allow it.;negative
Besides, banning guns isn't going to make it disappear, just like how illegal drugs are banned, though millions keep on consistently use them.;negative
If we disarmed all the law abiding citizens, the criminals would have no resistance.;negative
Criminals won't obey the law and get rid of their weapons, that is why they are criminals.;negative
Besides, I see something huge coming.;positive
Call me a conspiracy theorist but I feel I will need my guns to protect me very soon.;negative
Most guns used in murders and homicides are obtained illegally.;negative
It's also in our constitution, saying that wear have the right to bear and keep arms.;positive
having open carry laws would actually decrease crime.;negative
If you see somebody with a gun, you aren't going to be stupid enough to try and rob them are you?;negative
it's also a way to defend ourselves, many crimes are preventable if the victim had a way to defend themselves.;negative
There are also ways to get people to use and keep guns responsibly.;negative
Gun safety classes and marksmanship classes.;neutral
Can a gun kill someone?;neutral
Yes, but it can't fire without someone or something pulling its trigger!;negative
If we ban guns we have no defense against the criminals who get their guns illegally.;negative
It is easier for them to rob houses and stores if the criminal knows the other person has no good defense.;negative
If we ban guns we are going against the 2nd amendment (the Constitution)!!;negative
Citizens have the right to bear arms!;positive
You might say that guns kill people but they also protect people.;neutral
Guns should not be banned because defenseless people need some way to defend them selfs at home from robbers or who ever tries to harm said person.;negative
In way guns to hurt people, but the ultimately protect people as well.;positive
If you're alone at night in a park within the rough part of the inner city, you need a gun.;neutral
If guns were banned, someone with a knife might come up and rob you easily.;negative
Guns can kill people but they also provide a lot of protection.;neutral
Plus, if someone REALLY wanted to kill someone else, he would, gun or no gun.;negative
If criminals followed gun laws, gun control would work great.;negative
yes guns kill people,but it depends who is holding the gun.we need guns for wars,protection, if someone breaks in to your house what weapon would you chose a blunt object, a sharp object,or a gun.I choose GUN!;negative
Guns should not be banned from America.;negative
The people that are using guns for stupid crap should be banned from America.;negative

Are You Not Thinking Logically?;negative
Guns Purpose Are For Protection.;negative
Why Should We Ban Guns Because They Are Bought And Sold By PEOPLE Who Should Take More Effort Into Who THEY SELL These Guns To That Are Inflicted And Abused And Sadly Kill Other People.;negative
Why Take Away A Right To Every American To Keep A Fire Arm for The Sole Purpose Of Protecting His/Her Loved Ones, Belongings Or Property, Because Of The Mistakes And Wrong Intentions Of Disgusting, Self-Less And Corrupt Human Beings.;negative
It Is Just Like The Bans On Pit Bulls.;neutral

Ridiculous, Banning A Product/Thing, Only Create Doorways For Illegal Markets, And Bring Ideas Into The Heads Of Thousands (Just Like They Are Finding Ways Now To Abuse The Right To Own A Fire Arm) Ways To STILL Own And Sell Guns.;negative
It Isn't Going To Make Anything Better, It's Just Going To Make Matters More Dramatic.;negative
people who want to kill, will kill if you ban guns, they will kill with knives, or something else.;negative
when you ban guns murders will still happen.;neutral
And criminals will get guns some other way if they have to.;negative
banning guns will leave citizens unprotected from the criminals who get guns illegally.;negative
Allowing non-felon, non-drug addicted, non-psychiatric persons to carry guns for personal protection should be perfectly legal.;negative
Clearly gun crime is a problem in some places.;negative
And when we look at gun crime we find it is prevalent in places where citizens have been restricted from having guns and the crooks have all the (illegal) guns.;negative
Washington DC is an example.;positive
Add to that the fact that gun crime (in an area) is not related to the guns law-abiding citizens have.;negative
Its concentrated in high crime areas where gun laws are weakly enforced – at best.;neutral
What we really need is more guns on the street.....legal guns;neutral
No because it is our right to be able to defend oneself, and those we love.;neutral
Remeber it does not mean attack those who are a threat, it means only using them to defend ourselves, as civilians.;negative
I personally do not find a need for one, because I have all the protection I need.;negative

Terrorist are waiting to come into our children schools.;neutral

They are out there just waiting for their orders to strike!;neutral
Did we forget about Russia Beslan School in 2004?;neutral

Just think what one armed trained cop or good guy could have done!;neutral
Don’t think for a second it couldn’t happen to your school or your children.;neutral
It is time that citizen’s stand up for their unarmed cops/security and demand they are armed and trained.;neutral
if the government tries to take my guns they'll have to go through lots of bullets first plus the government would collapse and people would be killing the government for trying to take them.;negative

It's is becousethe victims don't have guns.;negative
Should we allso put a ban on knives to.;neutral
Like many have said, if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.;negative
Law abiding citizens would have to break said law to protect their property and family because the millions of felons out there who have already purchased guns illegally would not turn theirs in.;negative
Even if they never had bad intentions with them in the first place, spilling the beans that they even owned one would get them in trouble.;negative

Firearm companies would go out of business because there would be no customers.;negative
The ammunition manufactures would go out of business also because of the lack of users.;negative
The economy is already unstable as it is.;negative
This is one of the many reasons why guns should NOT be banned!;negative
If we did ban them it could turn into what the Prohibition was: a time where alcohol (and now perhaps guns) is sold on the black market and sought after arguably even more.;negative
If we ban guns it'll give more power to organized crime and also take away an economic chunk from the USA (from selling guns, hunting etc.).;negative
It should also be noted that by banning guns it could cause social upset and people protesting their right to wield arms, thus causing civil unrest and cracks within society.;negative
So Guns take and save lives and for those people who are talking bout kids getting hurt cuase they think its a toy the parents of those kids should put the guns in SAFE'S or somwhere where the children cant get to its called being responsible i mean sure some people are stupid and go buy a gun they know nothing about and either hurt themselves or somone their with.;negative
Now the second reason to keep guns if you have a robber that comes into your house and you think oh just let them have it and you hide somwhere and they know your there they will find u and either kill u or rape u now see if u had a gun in a safe under or by ur bed and a robber breaks in thats when u role out of bed open the safe grab ur gun hide somwhere and when he tries to get shoot him in the stomach or chest who cares if he dies or not he was the one who took his chance on it by robbing you.;negative

Robberies are illegal so if guns were illegal nothing would change.;negative
There are three main reasons why someone would break the law.;negative

Maryland has no guns on the streets or anywhere except your house or a firing range.;negative

However there are many states in the country that infringe on the right of certain types of gun ownership.;neutral
Lets take New Jersey, It is illegal to use hollow point bullets(which are legal just about everywhere else) because so one got a hold of bad information.;negative

In fear, you pull the fucking trigger, killing the poor bastard who just happened to be nearby.;negative
What did he ever do to you?;neutral
You get into an argument with a friend of yours.;neutral
You become so pissed you pull out your gun and put a few holes into his head.;negative
Ever hear of the Wild West, my good man?;positive
Feel free to run along.;neutral
i don't believe they should ban guns i think if everyone in the world had a gun there would be less crime.;negative
But for all the #Haters out there let me put it this way.;negative
Saying .;neutral
"""oh guns don't kill but Bullets do.""";neutral
"Is like saying, "" oh i didn't rape her but my dick did.''";neutral
Drop the whole subject people like you #Haters are targeting the wrong people the people who take the proper step in to receiving that right to carry are not the ones to go after its the mofos down the ally way that think that this is still high school in the real world and wanna play on a team (aka GANG) so get off the asses of those who obtain a proper permit and respect the fact that those people are the ones who would prolly put their life's on the line for all you baby's out there who are getting held up in a bank laying on the ground crying because the lady next to you has a bullet in her head and the only one in the room with a gun that you know of is the guys killing people.;negative
Think about it that way sure you can take the guns away from the good guys but can you take them away from the bad guys......;neutral
So you believe that everyone in the world having a gun would, essentially, lessen crime?;negative
Everyone includes criminals, thus it will make it far easier for them to commit crimes and murders.;positive
Neither guns nor bullets kill people.;neutral
People kill people.;neutral
Okay i am willing to reason with you lets do a for instince.;negative
Badguy: walks into a store full of 12 people.;positive
carring a springfeild xd40 Sub compact okay he only has 1 clip 1 clip holds 9 rounds!;negative
everyone in the store has a gun too and want to live!!;neutral
Badguy: shoots 1 person;neutral
?;neutral
: how many of those 11 people are going to shoot each other?;neutral
that makes it 1vs11 Now what's the badguy going to do.;neutral
How did said bad guy obtain a gun in the first place?;neutral
NO doubt they are readily available thanks to your lax gun laws.;negative
You're a moron.;negative
Bad guys will ALWAYS have guns.;negative
Hence bad guys.;negative
Law abiding citizens won't have one if the law said so.;negative
Hence law biding citizen.;negative
Bad guys want something and pull out that piece pointing at LAW ABIDING CITIZENS.;negative
2 options, citizens have guns and point back.;negative
Maybe bad guy have 1 shot off, maybe not.;negative
Or, all citizens scream and run, bad guy unloads on citizens.;neutral
Hmmmmmmmmm, sure, that will work.;positive
I'll preface this by saying that I have never in my life felt unsafe or afraid in my day to day comings and goings any where I have lived.;negative
I don't carry a concealed handgun because of a fearful existence or paranoia.;negative
"I also do not have a ""commando complex"" which would make me one of the worst kind of wannabes seeing I have never served in the military or law enforcement.";negative
I actually do not have any desire to use the gun on anyone and pray I never have to pull it for any reason.;negative
I don't place myself in dangerous situations or go places where I think danger may be present.;negative
In other words, my primary form of self defense is avoidance of potential danger, not confrontation.;negative
That does not make me a coward, because I have inadvertently and unintentionally found myself in situations where I have had to step in to defend other people (without a firearm), and I have responded pro-actively and decisively.;negative
So setting aside those common accusations against people who carry concealed handguns, why do I carry one?;negative
1.;neutral
Because I can.;positive
It is a right afforded to me by the U.S. Constitution and the Arkansas State constitution.;negative
It is afforded to me by a concealed carry law that law abiding citizens should never have had to fight for.;negative
Nonetheless, it has been hard won through long and expensive legislative action to develop what we have today.;negative
It is a right and the more of us who obtain the license and carry the guns, the harder it will be for controlling politicians to reverse it in the future.;positive
2.;neutral
Because it is my duty and responsibility to take advantage of a right afforded to me by what I believe was the guiding hand of an almighty God in the framing of the Constitution of the U.S. and the Bill of Rights.;positive
3.;neutral
Because I choose to take responsibilityy for my and my family's safety.;positive
Police generally arrive at a crime scene after the criminals are long gone and the devastation to citizen victims is already done.;negative
It is foolish indeed to believe that that our civil governments have the ability to protect us from the sub human predators of our society.;negative
4.;neutral
Because I live in a real world in which I recognize the dangers above are present.;positive
To do otherwise is to stick our heads in the sand and ignore an ever-present danger among us.;negative
5.;neutral
Because I want to be part of what makes criminals wonder if the next person they choose to assault may be the one that ends their life.;negative
The more law abiding citizens that are armed, the less sure criminals can be of the outcome of their actions against us.;negative
ok anti-gunners, imagine this situation, a mass murderer is looking for a college to attack.;negative
He sees two different colleges.;positive
A sign on the first college says gun free zone, and a sign on the second college says armed staff and students.;negative
What college do you think he's going to pick.;neutral
Mass murderers should be detected and treated.;negative
And should NOT have access to guns.;negative
Don't you see where the problem is?;negative
Stupid argument.;neutral
You're using an extreme example to demonstrate the legitimacy of gun ownership?;neutral
I can chop and screw your argument down to make it more complex, as you should have done from the very beginning anyway.;negative
1) A mass murder will have some form of mental psychosis, or history of violence.;negative
This means that in a state/country where it is required by law to have a full medical and criminal background check cleared in order to obtain a license to yield a weapon, this mass murderer wouldn't have a chance at obtaining a gun in the first place.;negative
Ban guns altogether?;neutral
They'd have to turn to the black market.;neutral
And this isn't an easy process, either.;negative
2) Let's say where this man lives, guns are banned.;neutral
If he wants to go on a killing spree he would have to be extremely dedicated to the cause.;neutral
Whether or not he obtains a gun, this guy is clearly dangerous and will kill with any means necessary.;negative
3) There are more incidences of school shoot outs in America compared to any other developed country in the world.;negative
What is the difference between America and the UK, Australia or Canada?;neutral
Well let's see here... oh yeah.;positive
Guns.;neutral
"4) ""Guns don't kill people, people do"".";neutral
Hm?;neutral
Of course - a gun is an inanimate object.;neutral
However, missing the big picture here.;neutral
More guns = higher homicide rates.;negative
Less guns = lower homicide rates.;negative
Are Americans just more violent by nature or are you too hung up on your 2nd amendment rights to acknowledge there is a problem with guns?;negative
You're an idiot, it happens in U.S. ALLLLLLL the time.;negative
Not just in U.S. perhaps, EVERYWHERE!;negative
Shoot out in school is a form of violence.;negative
What about gang fights between schools.;neutral
Maybe we should ban school uniforms too.;neutral
DERB DERB!;neutral
NO!;neutral
If this were to happen that would be a major infringement on our Second Amendment to The Constitution of The United States.;negative
With more armed citizens, that could deter criminals from committing crimes.;negative
More armed citizens make the country safer.;negative
that's it.;neutral
Get a gun for every one... you really have a problem in the USA with people supporting violence views such as this one.;negative
Safety comes from goodness, trust, peace, love, not arms!;positive
Guns do kill people but they save many more lives than they kill.;neutral
Also some people get alot of food that they need form hunting.;negative
You ban this you kill them.;neutral
With all my respect, you are mixing things up.;positive
Weapons used by the army are a different thing.;negative
Weapons used for hunting animals are also a different thing.;negative
But selling to just about anybody weapons like the ones I see on TV sold in the USA is simply outrageous.;negative
YOU ARE KILLING EACH OTHER!;negative
stop this madness please;neutral
I am not mixing up.;negative
Many crimes are also committed with guns that are used for hunting.;neutral
These assult weapons and guns that are more deadly are bought by collectors and sport shooters.;negative
The few who get guns for killing often pre-meditate.;neutral
They can't get the M16 that they saw on Tv?;negative
they will switch to something else.;neutral
A boltaction hunting rifle or another simiautomatic rifle.;negative
I am sorry to burst your bubble but killings like this will never stop.;negative
There are bad men out there that want to hurt others either because they like it, because they got mad at someone, or to better them selves.;negative
Getting rid of assult weapons will do nothing.;negative
I do though applaud you for saying, with all due respect.;positive
I find few who show some form of respect on this site.;neutral
You will never end violence with more violence.;negative
There must be a different approach.;positive
Education, detection of violent people, information, etc, etc but providing easy access to guns is a poor way of trying to get a safe country.;negative
In my opinion.;neutral
Never end violence with violence, WW1 and WW2.;negative
There are other approaches but many people are impaticent and want to take the easier way.;neutral
You can't allways detect violent people.;negative
I am a calm person, i don't get normaly get mad and i don't lash out at people.;negative
I follow rules.;neutral
You would know this if you knew me in person.;neutral
Last year though, in Woods class at school, i was bullied and i was driven to the point where i wanted the guy to die.;negative
I delt with it through words but if it went much further i don't know what would have happened.;neutral
Yes i guess that your point, there is a smarter way around things but this is america.;negative
People don't want to get rid of guns.;negative
I respect your oppion and understand its points.;positive
Its just that i choose the other side.;neutral
"I can see that none of us will budge; call a truce on this one?";negative
If guns were banned then criminals would go to knives and or crossbows, would you ban those too?;negative
We are not talking about knives here... we are talking about guns.;negative
You have to start fixing a society somewhere and eliminating violence-inducing weapons is a first and important step;neutral
Let is say that guns were banned in America, which would never happen there are too many gun lovers here.;negative
But theroeticly....;positive
Wouldbe criminals would get the gun(s) they wanted anyways.;negative
And a cheap gun is easy to make anyways.;negative
If guns were taken away then they would switch to that or go with shooting people with arrows or stabbing.;negative
Violence will never be elliminated.;negative
This task is impossible.;neutral
Yes according to statistics many are killed by gun but many more are saved by them.;negative
If you look at all these horrific mass shootings, like Columbine, Virginia Tech, and the Colorado theater shooting, what did they all have in common?;negative
They were all GUN-FREE ZONES.;neutral
Meaning that only those who care about laws will follow them.;neutral
I dont think guns should be banded but i do think we need to get rid of the black market sales of guns i live here in Oklahoma where you can go to the state fair grounds where they have a gun and knife show and they dont even check back grounds or nothing that is a bad loop hole in the system and you can buy a ar15 ak47 and so on but if you go in a regular gun shop here you can not buy that type of weapon i think those type of rifles should stay in the military not on the streets but i also think if people want to carry or have one in there homes they should have to go to a mandatory gun course and it not be very simple like it is here where i live and get there licence to beable to buy and own one and some type of mental evaluation this can be all done and probably costly but it will make some kinda of a difference because we all need to protect our self's and i believe that will help keep most of the insane nuts from just going out there and being able to buy one i love my freedom and being able to own my guns and being able to pack one to protect my self but i think the laws are just to loose just for anybody to go in a store and buy one i know you have to go thru a backgroung check but to me thats not good enough because not every body has a felony record but they still dont have any business owning one and not even capable of shooting one but they just walk out the door with no training and most of them with no clue on how to shoot one so theres my thought and opinion im sure most wont agree because they think its an infringement on our 2nd admitment right;negative
i am surprised that nobody has said anything about the jobs that would be lost if they ban semi auto firearms.;negative
one of the only branches of business that is flourishing right now.;neutral
lets put more people out of work shall we.;neutral
back to the task at hand.;neutral
most vehicles we drive in u.s. have the capability to go over 100 mph.;neutral
these vehicles are used every day on roads that will never Legally allow you to drive over 80.;negative
yet everybody still buys these 100 mph + vehicles.;negative
car accidents and vehicle related deaths by far out weigh the firearm related deaths.;negative
why arent they banned and have all of the cars thrown in a big pit and burned while we all walk to work how would that be.;negative
of course nobody needs the cars to go over 100 mph.;negative
but guess what we have them.;neutral
why.;neutral
because WE CAN.;neutral
do we really need semi auto weapons.;negative
maybe, maybe not.;neutral
but there is more cause to ban 100+ mph cars than firearms.;negative
and by the way all of you idiot peace blah blah blah hippies out there.;negative
i am an American and i love my cars that can go over 100 mph i love my cheeseburgers and i enjoy shooting my semi auto firearms.;positive
not for the soul purpose of killing people, but for my own personal enjoyment.;negative
"America was built with the understanding that a corrupt government would never allow their ""subjects"" to have firearms.";neutral
why do you think they fled and came here in the first place.;neutral
that is why it is important to keep this right in the constitution and not a chopped and diced version that corrupt politicians have molded to suit there needs.;negative
but a pure constitution that means what it states.;positive
that i have the right to keep and bear arms.;positive
even semi auto rifles and handguns.;negative
Guns don't kill people, if they did, they would go to jail for murder- not the murderers.;negative
Jk they kill peoplebut are good for self defense.;negative
If they were illegalized, it would lead to black market sales which would lead to higher crime.;negative
If it is legal, the government can use the money to do stuff.;negative
I know this is an old debate but in light of today's events in Connecticut I have been doing a little poking around on the internet and came across this...;neutral
Here's my thought - Criminals and anyone who wants to get their hands on a gun, any gun, can and will.;negative
They don't care that guns are outlawed - in fact, that spurs some people on to have one just because the government says they can't.;negative
"What, do we think that a criminal is going to sigh, throw up their hands and say ""Gee, I guess I can't own a gun - gotta find something more productive and socially acceptable to do... "" No, in fact - if we ban guns I believe the criminals are going to rejoice because it gives them an upper hand when committing their crimes.";negative
Look at drugs - they are outlawed and banned but our children today are STILL dying from overdoses because drugs are still on the street.;negative
It didn't deter criminals from owning, using or distributing it.;negative
It will be the same with guns.;neutral
Tighter control - perhaps - but until you can GUARANTEE that no one, ever again, will be able to have a gun in their hands when coming into contact with me, I say we can't ban guns!;negative
Attempting to use the logic that guns should be outlawed solely based on the fact that they make it easier to commit crimes and are involved in such a high number of crimes and deaths each year has me wondering what these same people would say about alcohol.;negative
Alcohol ranks higher than guns in both categories.;positive
No.;neutral
http://www.createdebate.com/debate/show/ Gun_control_laws_don_t_work_in_Europe_or_anywhere_else_What_does_work_is_an_armed_society;neutral
Typically it is the maniacs who own the guns who kill people.;negative
Sometimes, other methods of killing are used and have larger effects.;negative
For example, millions of jews were killed during the Holocaust, sometimes with guns, but more times than not they were killed by poison.;negative
Sometimes, bombs or blades are used more than guns.;negative
If no one has a gun, criminals will find some way of getting guns and killing the upstanding American citizen.;negative
I own a gun!;neutral
check the news- I haven't hurt a soul except for the animals I was going to eat.;negative
Heroin, weed, coke, meth, all of these things are illegal but the illegal drug business is worth over 1 billion dollars in the US!;negative
If a criminal wants a gun he will get one just like drugs.;negative
The only thing that would change is next time someone decided to kill someone it would be like shooting fish in a barrel!;negative
We should have a right to defend ourselves!!!;negative
i don't believe that the problem is weapons.;negative
the problem in this nation is the poor up bringing of children, we have lost the values that built this great country, we have lost respect for human life and forgot that we are brothers and sisters in humanity and the channels of communication have been shadowed by violence and newer generations that only believe in the importance of self image and respect in the streets.;negative
when i was an 8 year old girl my dad took me hunting for the first time, when i shot the rifle he gave me, i instantly fell in love with the sport.;negative
but it wasn't just the sport he taught me about, he also showed me the huge responsibility that lies behind that trigger but most of all he taught me that something so small like a bullet could change your life and someone Else's in the blink of an eye, and if you ever harm someone with it... it must come down to fearing for your life.;negative
what we need in this country is education.;neutral
we spend more money in prisons then colleges and then wonder why parents are not educating children with values now a days.;negative
it isn't guns that kill people, is the mentality these people carry around in their heads that kill other people.;negative
there is a bigger picture then what we are seeing here, and a bigger monster to tackle.;positive
if someone wants to kill, they will kill, gun or no gun.;negative
banning guns is not the solution.;negative
education is.;neutral
No, because it is a second amendment right to allow citizens to keep firearms.;neutral
To control the sale of them is one thing, to ban them entirely is unconstitutional and a over reaction.;negative
Look at all the car accidents that result from reckless drivers.;neutral
Should we ban the cars to prevent such accidents.;neutral
No.;neutral
Such a overreaction is like burning down a house trying to roast a pig.;negative
But, do they not ban drunk drivers from driving again?;negative
I see you fail to understand the point of banning weapons.;negative
Just as cars do not kill people, but their drivers do, so do the owners of handguns.;negative
It is difficult to control those who would own guns just as it is difficult to control those who own cars.;negative
We cannot ban cars, BUT, we can ban those who have proven to be difficult the right to drive them.;negative
As weapons are not cars, but objects designed SOLELY TO KILL, they should be banned outright.;negative
Thing is, full on gun bans don't work.;negative
Not if you already have really lax gun laws to begin with.;negative
Not even restrictions would work in our society.;negative
You see, millions, if not, probably trillions of firearms and related items have been diffused across the United states over the past sixty years.;negative
Like all material items, a lot of these guns, and I mean A LOT, have been traded, sold, bought again, or locked away in storage and forgotten.;negative
A lot of them at gun shows, where one can purchase a new or used firearm without having to register it.;negative
Even if the government were to go down the list, name by name, of everyone who's registered a firearm, at least 95% of those names would be outdated, as the owner had sold it a long time ago.;negative
My next point is that we would be defenseless.;negative
Look at Australia, for instance.;neutral
One small shooting and -BOOM!;neutral
- No more guns.;neutral
Of course, guns are not fully banned, but are really hard to acquire.;negative
That being said, when the government asked for all the guns back, the good, law-abiding people coughed them up, while the criminals kept them.;positive
This resulted in an increased crime rate.;negative
The baddies had nothing to fear, because the odds that their targets had a weapon was slim to none.;negative
"Lastly, even if you banned guns, and everyone -even the criminals- handed them in like good little minions, the criminals could very easily just acquire them illegally; That, or come after you with a hatchet or machete.";negative
Honestly, if I had a choice, I'd rather be popped once in the head with a .45 than be hacked to death, piece by piece, while I'm still breathing.;negative
Wouldn't you?;neutral
ENFORCE THE LAWS WE ALREADY HAVE, MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE DIE FROM DRUNK DRIVING AND MOST OF THEM ARE FROM SECOND AND THIRD OFFENDERS BECAUSE SOME PEICE OF SHIT MONEY HUNGRY LAWER GOT THEM OFF.;negative
tHE ASSHOLE WHO KILLED THOSE TWO FIREMAN ONLY DID 18 YEARS IN JAIL FOR KILLING HIS GRAND MOTHER WITH A HAMMER, HE KILLED A HUMAN BEING WITH A FREAKING HAMMER FOR GOD SAKE AND SOME LAWER GOT HIM TO ONLY SERVE 18 YEARS, PUT THAT LAWERS NAME ON THE INTERNET ALONG WITH THE JUDGE WHO LET HIM OUT.;negative
COME TO MY HOUSE AND TRY AND TAKE MY GUNS I ACTUALLY LEAVE MY DOORS UNLOCKED HOPING SOME POROLLED ASS HOLE BREAKS IN.;negative
IF MORE PEOPLE CARRIED GUNS ASSHOLES WOULD HAVE TO THINK TWICE ABOUT COMMITING A CRIME;negative
What sucks is both sides have some valid points but one side is going about it all wrong.;negative
Limiting guns or their capacities to hold ammunition will not stop the violence it will only change the tools used but probably not even that as we see in examples.;negative
Whats worse than guns in this country is our technicalities.;negative
All a technicality should do is save someone from being put to death.;negative
There should be no instances where we consider someones background for a crime committed and its sentence.;negative
But then again there are so many things considered a crime in this country any more just to generate capital that everything needs to be considered before a change like that can happen.;negative
We've complicated things so much because we allow feelings get in the way of the real agenda.;negative
Protection is a basic right from anyone and from anything, murder is not and until that is addressed, all these what-if scenarios to create an agenda are wrong.;negative
Yes they occur and must be addressed but it should not be mixed into another agenda.;negative
The gun owners using any verbal ammunition no pun intended to protect their rights as you have seen are only retaliating to all these what-if scenarios you create to infringe on their rights, which is also your right if you choose to accept it.;negative
These men and women have not done anything wrong for you to attack them and are only defending themselves from an attack.;negative
The second amendment was put into law by the law for they knew the travesties that could happen when law corrupts.;negative
We as individuals know how the country 'should' work but we do not see all the gears turning and changing and many times these gedon'tdont get oiled or over oiled and we must keep our basic rights unscathed or we will then be scathed.;negative
I understand we are complex beings but if we keep over complicating certain things the real problems will never get addressed.;neutral
So to all you homos who write all these long drawn out stories thinking because of it your agenda has won because of it.;negative
Eat this.;neutral
Mines bigger than most of yours and Im not talking about my story haha and I'm trained not controlled for all you wise a$$es haha.;negative
Tell me, what is the entire point of having a police force?;neutral
If you have weapons, then why bother keeping a police force?;negative
Or a military for that matter?;neutral
People like you simple do not get it.;negative
The number 1 weapon used in a violent crime is a baseball bat... Not a gun.;negative
Plus, when your endangered, the police are minutes away when only seconds count to save your life.;negative
Guns should not be banned because then the government would become to powerful.;negative
If it is a right, then that shouldn't be able to be taken away from you.;negative
they should take baseball bats away before guns because #1, they are easier to get.;negative
also, a gun is only dangerous if its used by the wrong person.;negative

its not everyone's right to have a gun but that doesn't mean they should be banned.;negative
we just need a true sense of self control and some more protection against guns by simply giving out bullet proof vest as some sort of promotion or public service.;negative
Guns don't kill people.;neutral
There should be perhaps more restrictions or background checks (for people with mental disorders, etc.) but the only people that would be affected by banning guns would be the lawful citizens.;negative
If you make it illegal to rob a bank, the criminals would continue robbing banks even if it was illegal.;negative
Criminals would still use guns.;neutral
They don't care what the law is.;negative
Responsible gun owners (like myself) use them for lawful reasons.;negative
Mainly I have guns for hunting, riflery, etc.;negative
Not even with an emphasis on personal protection, however not against it.;negative
Disarmed People = Are Dominated People;neutral
Simple as that so do we really want to ban guns?;negative
With bigger, more important issues than gun control looming around, I think gun control can wait.;negative
Plus, it isn't exactly a nat'l security threat, considering the current population, roughly 314 million strong, and birth rates in the US, 30k lives to gun related homicide a year is a small price to pay.;negative
You'd think, with the gun control side composed of lawyers with remarkable skill, they'd know better than to badger people with emotional pleas like their favorite argument, think of the children.;negative
These incidents are famous because they happen so rarely.;neutral

...oops, this is an accidental post, my argument is up there ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^;negative
I don't understand why people think that by guns being banned in America would reduce crime?;negative
Of course it won't stop crime because criminals are not going to go buy a gun legally anyway, but rather from the back of the van.;negative
Large majority of gun owners do not like the idea of the background check, which in my opinion does is a very good.;negative
I had a background check when I purchased my gun and no problems at all.;negative
I have absolutely no problem with that.;positive
Of course, it won't stop criminals completely, but at least it will reduce the number of those who should not own guns.;negative
In addition, criminals will think twice about harming someone when you live in a state where the gun laws are not so strict........and no, I am not a NRA member nor do I ever wish to be one.;negative
Guns are two sided.;neutral
They can protect you when someone breaks into your house, but they can hurt if someone pulls one on you.;neutral
• People can use the guns for self-defence.;negative
• If we ban it, gangsters will be the only ones to be able to have guns by smuggling it.;negative
We won’t be able to defend ourselves.;negative
• Many people will not use it to kill people so it wouldn’t matter a lot if everyone could get one.;negative
• People will not be able to hunt for recreation.;negative

Not only are these toy fun and look good, they are a simble of American freedom.;positive
However gun education and gun safty are important.;neutral
For example, teach a child not to play with guns and that they can and will kill people.;negative
Assualt guns are already tough to come by, this would only effect law abiding citizens!;negative
It would also mean people who illeagaly buy guns can so easily kill us without guns.;neutral

Once after this debate went major I set out a gun with it loaded setting it in a lawn chair right beside me in my front yard and numerous people went by like the mailman guys on motorcycles and little girls playing and despite all the chances the gun had to shot someone about one thousand times that day and it never happened but then I went hunting found a nice deer and then I yes I shot the deer and it died by who me;negative
Have you ever noticed that guns never get credit for killing but the person does ?;neutral
That's because the person kills the person shots not the gun unless there like the toy story characters and walk around when I'm not looking which I highly doubt so people kill people and people toasts toast;negative
With guns there is less crime, with no guns crime will go up by 99%;negative
An absolutely ridiculous viewpoint.;negative
Those who commit such crimes have access to guns.;neutral
Remove such access and you have no crime.;neutral
One need only create a stronger police force, with tougher laws to back them up.;negative
The liberals have so weakened our laws against criminals that it is absurd.;negative
Capital punishment should be brought back and in greater force.;positive
Armed gangs should be wiped out via the use of your military.;negative
If you have a military, USE IT.;negative
Guns most certainly should be banned in America.;positive
As a Canadian, I know this argument better than any American alive today.;negative
Whilst true that guns do not kill people, they provide those with the ability to kill.;positive
Look at all of those school murders.;neutral
The theatre murders.;neutral
Need I go on?;neutral
Had those who committed the murders been denied access to such weapons, those children would still be alive today.;positive
To allow others the ability to own guns puts our children in danger.;neutral
This isn't very new, but it's true.;neutral
If guns are outlawed, only outlaws have guns.;negative
I've heard supporters of gun control peck at this unoriginality, claiming it to be a weakness.;negative
The reason we repeat this is because it's true.;positive
Gun control needs to die and the people supported gun control should focus on what makes criminals.;negative
Also, before you blame money, it's not money, it's finding wants to be more important than things like morals and others;negative
NO!;neutral
Obama= OneBigAssMistakeAmerica!;neutral

The Second Amendment: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.;positive
NO!!!;neutral
This great nation’s founding fathers adopted the 2nd Amendment in 1791, which protects the right of individuals to keep and bear arms in America:;positive
“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”;positive
I believe that once ultra liberal politicians and voters begin (actually they have already begun) to chip away and erode our inalienable constitutional rights, American as we currently know it, will quickly begin to implode within and eventually crumble.;negative
Just read history…its happened repeatedly since the dawn of civilization.;neutral
If the 2nd amendment were to go away, then guess what, so then will the 1st amendment, 3rd amendment, 4 amendment, and so on.;negative
Starting to see a pattern here America?;neutral
Guns are just inanimate objects, no different than a car, a knife, a hammer or a baseball bat (all of which can just as easily kill people BTW).;negative
Hmmm, so lets outlaw cars, knives, hammers and baseball bats too.;positive
Yea right.;positive
Do you see how utterly ridiculous and useless gun control is!;negative
So you see…guns don’t kill people…people kill people.;negative
Lets focus on fixing the root of America's core problems: the mental health crisis, stop letting prisoners out of prison, stronger parental control over their children playing violent video games and TV, fixing our broken judicial system, and the list goes on and on.;negative
Besides…even if all guns were confiscated by the government, tens of thousands of illegal guns will still be easily attainable via the black market and the cartels.;negative
Idiots with guns: yes.;neutral
Guns in general: no.;negative
If you don't keep your weapon secure around children, or give a machine gun to a kid to fire at your gun range( wtf?);negative
or are deemed mentally unstable you should be deemed unworthy to carry a deadly firearm.;neutral
Responsible people should own guns.;neutral
The purpose of guns isn't to kill people.;negative
It's what people do with them, but it's not their purpose.;negative
Just like a kitchen knife isn't meant to cut things.;negative
It's meant to prepare food, as a gun is meant for protection.;negative
Also, mass shootings are a pretty recent phenomena and are relatively rare in the scope of gun violence.;positive
Guns save way more people than they endanger, it's just that mass shootings make for juicier stories than self-protection in a home invasion.;negative
Banning guns is essentially taking away our INALIENABLE right to protect ourselves.;positive
Criminals don't follow the law, so what makes you think a criminal wouldn't own a gun illegally in a ban.;negative
The only thing that happens is an imbalance of power has been made.;negative
Certain people, namely criminals and police, are now more powerful than the people in need of protection.;positive
"As for ""heavier"" guns, I think that ownership of them comes with freedom.";positive
Anyone has the choice to own a fast car, but those kill more people than guns do, so why not ban them?;negative
Because it's ridiculous.;negative
I am against banning guns in America, but this argument does not make sense.;negative
The purpose of a gun is to fire a lethal projectile for the purposes of hunting or protection, and the purpose of a kitchen knife is to cut things for the purpose of food preparation.;negative
That is very true.;positive
You'll get far more viewers from covering mass shootings than you will covering a story about how gun related crimes are at a historic low, and still decreasing.;negative
It doesn't take away our inalienable right to protect ourselves, it just makes it harder.;negative
One could still protect themselves without a gun, though you'd have to try a lot harder.;negative
As for criminals, the fact that some people will break a law is generally not considered a good reason to avoid having said law all together.;negative
Guns are security and safety tools.;neutral
If you take them away there is less security.;negative
...which is why in America, guns are used as a murder weapon twice as often as every other murder weapon combined.;negative
That report shows clearly that it's people killing people, not guns.;negative
Look at Switzerland.;neutral
"And then there are lies, damn lies and statistics. """;negative
... children are already pretty safe in schools as is.;negative
"A very small number of the 30,000 annual gun deaths take place in schools.""";negative
So where's the problem?;neutral
What are these lies?;neutral
And how do you know they are lies?;neutral
Can a gun get up, walk over to someone, and shoot them?;negative
No.;neutral
It's the person behind the gun because think about it.;neutral
For a war or conflict to be started, it needs to be started by someone who can declare war.;negative
"Someone who can say, ""this is war"".";negative
Guns can make decisions, guns can't talk, guns can't move around on there own.;negative
For the people who think guns shouldn't be aloud I think live in a cartoon, a g rated cartoon.;negative
No Guns don't kill people, its the person who holds it that kills people.;negative
As a tool, guns certainly kill people.;neutral
Well, bullets do, rather, but that's nit picking.;negative
The person using the gun is indeed responsible, but when one uses a tool, that tool is certainly being used.;negative
So yes, the bullet fired by the gun is doing the killing.;negative
The person who holds it simply decides who is being killed.;positive
"It's nonsense, but that's the nature of this whole ""Guns don't kill people, people do"" shtick that really has no legitimate place in a conversation about guns.";negative
Guns are useful, especially if a government would be susceptible to tyrannism, and I would put verification laws that would go survey and examine ones person mental health etc., Yes it has a legitimate place in the conversation about guns... Who uses the guns?;negative
People, and who's been doing terror attacks?;neutral
People, reasons why these people do terror attacks?;neutral
Depression and Illegal or unlicensed firearms and most of them have mental disabilities.;negative
Guns do not do the killing.;negative
It is a mere choice whether to partake in such a demeaning activity.;negative
You are the murderer, not the gun.;negative
In fact, weaponry can also be argued to be a manoeuver of self defence!;negative
Take that!;neutral
.;neutral
guns are a waste of fuckingg time, ban them now!!!!!!!!!!!!;negative
They are not a waste.;negative
I use them for hunting, an important pastime not only for food but for growing closer with my family for which it is a tradition.;positive
Also for personal protection, and marksmanship, a worthwhile hobby.;positive
ummm you appear to view the other side.;positive
maybe you should figure out which side you are on first.;negative
but your point is perfect.;positive
I am going to guess you own a gun.;negative
Yah duh, he just said he uses it lololol Though I also think it's a good point;positive
.;neutral
Hunting is an important pasttime?;neutral
Never heard of a grocery store?;neutral
A very relevant point in today's society.;positive
It's not like hunting is the only way to get food anymore.;negative
it only allows criminals to commit crimes.;negative
It definetly doesnt protect anyone from anything, it only harms the people of this country.;negative
Riddle me this: How would one STOP a criminal with a gun who is committing a crime?;negative
precisely what we are proposing, the fact that all guns will be illegal (aside from certain licenced people) will mean that guns arent allowed and no one has gunsmeaning that the only people with the guns are outlaws and can be dealt with through law;negative
that is a rediculous arguement, thats like saying, people still murder we may as well make it legal.;negative
and this is something i dont understand about you americans, why do you want guns so much?;positive
the only thing they are there for is to kill and harm others;neutral
the fact that you have some flimsy piece of paper;negative
i dont see a single valid reason why you should have a gun and yet there are plenty of reasons that you shouldnt have them.;positive
the war on drugs we have to fight just like we fight the war on terrorism, it may not be sucessful but its far better than the alternative.;negative
Do you really think that if the government were to try and take over, that your 22 in your gunsafe is going to hold off trained soldiers with automatic rifles?;negative
In today's society there is no reason for guns.;negative
The right to bear arms was fine when everyone had the same revolver or single-round chambered rifle, but things have changed a bit since then.;positive
if there was a so called tyrant, then he probably has taken over the militia, and do you think that you would win against a trained solider who probably has better weapons.;negative
simply being dangerous is not grounds for banning an object.;negative
Home invasions almost always means that they are just there for your stuff;neutral
Uh, who's going to collect the insurance?;neutral
why would they enter my house unarmed if they knew that chances were that I would have a gun;negative
guns aren't needed on the daily by people outside of the armed forces so i really don't see a need for us carrying guns.;negative
it only leads to violence and gangbanging anyways...;neutral
besides, i remember reading once that in the countries that had banned guns and an over 90% less deaths to weaponry than in the u.s. now THAT says something.;negative
I say that guns should be banned because they are killing thousands of people each week;neutral
You are absolutely wrong about the second amendment being put in place to prevent a British invasion or coup.;negative
It was put in place partially to allow the creation of militias.;negative
You're also wrong about guns making crime rates go higher, take a look at Switzerland.;negative
Men there are required to own automatic weapons and yet they have next to no crime rate.;negative
Their lack of a standing army is what was originally for seen for the United States, or a system similar.;negative
A small standing army to form the core of a greater force in times of war.;negative
That is what the second amendment implies.;neutral
Obviously you know little about guns, a shotgun is probably one of the least threatening weapons to people.;negative
Their limited range for their weight and length makes them impractical for crime, but perfect for the defense of ones home.;positive
The guns aren't the problem its people and don't start blaming poverty, or education.;negative
Just because you're poor doesn't mean that you have to kill someone to improve your life.;negative
There are many ways to do that.;positive
So long as guns exist people will always find a way to acquire them.;negative
By reducing the number of honest, law abiding citizens with the capability to protect themselves from these criminals you're asking for a breakdown of order.;negative
But I diverge from the topic at hand.;positive
Point is only an idiot points a gun anywhere near a person they don't want to kill.;negative
There's no such thing as a gun related accident, gun related deaths almost always are caused by carelessness or stupidity or both.;negative
Presence of guns around us just provide an acceleration to this kind of a thinking and encourages us to act upon him and kill that person.;negative
The two reasons why people use guns in America:;neutral
1.;neutral
Get things like money, power, respect (kill people, hold up stores, stuff like that);negative
2.;neutral
Protect us from each other because we want money, power, etc.;negative
If we all had equal money, power, and respect, there wouldn't be any competition, therefore no hate, no greed, etc.;negative
You draw with a pencil.;positive
You kill with a gun.;neutral
Firstly, knives and cars are not commonly used to murder people.;negative
You say that cars are considered as WEAPONS by the cops?;neutral
They are not considered as a WEAPONS.;negative
They are used by cops as roadblocks and chasing activities.;negative
Do you think them as MURDERS?;neutral
Quite funny though!;positive
That is a funny point you have raised.;positive
Just consider the prime uses of the things which are considered weapons by you.;negative
in the wrong hands.;neutral
i don't believe they should ban guns i think if everyone in the world had a gun there would be less crime.;negative
Saying .;neutral
"""oh guns don't kill but Bullets do.""";neutral
"Is like saying, "" oh i didn't rape her but my dick did.''";neutral
The purpose of guns isn't to kill people.;negative
It's what people do with them, but it's not their purpose.;negative
Just like a kitchen knife isn't meant to cut things.;negative
It's meant to prepare food, as a gun is meant for protection.;negative
Guns save way more people than they endanger, it's just that mass shootings make for juicier stories than self-protection in a home invasion.;negative
Banning guns is essentially taking away our INALIENABLE right to protect ourselves.;positive
Criminals don't follow the law, so what makes you think a criminal wouldn't own a gun illegally in a ban.;negative
And then there are lies, damn lies and statistics.;negative
How am I going to kill a person without a gun?;neutral
I could never stab someone... that's too up close and personal for me and poison takes too long... Nope guns are the way to go.;negative
Yo yeea , guns is bettah, ah love seeing gat fights ya'll is mad.;negative
It has been observed that a society who are permitted to carry arms have lower rates of 'confrontational' crime.;negative
By this I mean, criminals are deterred by the possibility of being shot, and so even though people commit crimes with guns by taking advantage of the law, on balance it is better to have them.;negative
Besides, what happened the last time we banned something (alcohol) the American public loved?;negative
Massive increases in its trade.;neutral
Aside from that, how would we confiscate these mountains of weaponry?;negative
If 10% resisted and used the guns on police who tried to take the weapons, we'd have quite a large pile of dead police officers.;negative
In short, it would be almost a war within itself, as well as being the less desirable scenario.;negative
Guns are dangerous and they should be banned in America because this country has terrible gun violence.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral

Letting untrained and mentally ill own assault weapon and special ammo ...;neutral
so fuckheads like you would like the government to test every citizen annually and judge if they are mentally ok?;negative
fuck you and that type of control.;positive
What about legal system like in civilized countries?;neutral
There is no reason why random drunks should own assault weapons ... .22 handgun will protect anyone enough... and like in for example Czech Republic if you want to own a weapon you have undergo: psychological evaluation, health check, fire range training, legal stuff, background check, fist aid training, you have to be 25 years old, then you may purchase weapon class E (handgun).;negative
There is obvious exception for former military, cops...;negative
"there are many hoops to buying/owning ""assault weapons"" but im guessing you dont dont know the true definition to what they really are.";positive

and just imagine all the benefits/profits that would give them/gov to conduct such studies/control.;negative
that ridiculous, 25yo and up;negative

Assault rifles are single purpose devices, designed to kill as many people as possible, not to harm but to kill whole groups of people.;negative
It is an offence weapon.;negative
Not practical for personal defence at all.;neutral
But they are not designed with single purpose of mass killing.;negative
Untested people with weapons ....;positive
yeah lets give mentally ill people automatic weapons... or random drunk, religious weirdos... how that can get wrong...;negative
Like in the UK, Australia or Japan?;neutral
Czech rep....?;neutral
it works for them ...on the other side no gun law like in the US or somalia is not doing very good.;neutral
In movies maybe :D ...one hit in chest, head or legs stops anyone;neutral
were done here...youre obviously not a rational thinker and very uneducated on the subject;negative
Just to let you know, this doesn't show you understand at all what an assault rifle is.;negative
I have been pretty much forced to carry one around for couple of years, so I quite have an idea what it could be...;negative
Doesn't make me any less right.;negative
You seem to have the least knowledge of guns for anyone who has to carry one regularly.;negative
This statement shows you are a fool.;negative
You went from banning people with mental conditions to people who like to drink alcohol.;neutral
That's a huge jump.;neutral
This shows that you can't be talked to.;neutral
You go from talking about assault weapons to only allowing a .22 handgun.;negative
Another huge jump.;neutral
How are we supposed to have a real discussion about gun control if nothing you say is connected?;neutral
Former cop shot guy in movie theater in Florida because he was playing with his phone.;negative
No, weapons are not chew toys.;neutral
It should not be held by irresponsible people, which drunks and retards clearly are.;negative
simply because .22 is enough, point of self defence is in defending yourself no to kill everybody around...;negative
f he was fired for being mentally fucked, he would not be given a right to carry weapon... which would prevent the shooting.;negative
Bringing up chew toys shows you are an idiot.;negative
We can't take guns away from drunks because drunk is not a permanent affliction like retardation.;negative
How much have you banned in between.;neutral
You complained about assault rifles then banned a whole lot more.;negative
Your stance is not clear.;negative
He wasn't mentally fucked, so now what?;negative
He was retired.;neutral
There is no reason why civilians should be able to buy/own large calibres, large clips, silencers, special ammo or automatic weapons.;negative
Drunks are same as any other drug addicts.;negative
Mentally ill ... In more civilised countries strict gun laws works.;negative
You are brainwashed by weapons lobby.;neutral
To buy more and more, and more .....;neutral
Why not to allow civilians to own mortars, RPGs, chemical weapons?;negative
...for self defence off course... 2nd amendment ... so?;negative
There is only one reason to take away the guns of civilians and allow the government agencies to use them, and that is to conquer the citizens.;negative
Drunks are not the same as any other addict.;negative
Those are alcoholics.;neutral
The term drunk should not be brought up in a gun control debate unless you prefer to sound like an idiot.;negative
No, I am brainwashed by the liberals who constantly want to take away my right to own a gun.;negative
I haven't even begin to discuss what should be banned or not.;negative
I am only pointing out that you are a complete idiot.;negative
Yes we live in 17th century when governments do not have tanks, jets, bomber, rockets, submarines, ships drones...;negative
now is everybody safe, it's rifle against rifle ....;negative

You want to take away the rifles.;neutral
Your scenario of rifle against rifle wouldn't happen.;negative
"I hoped that because I was talking about ""17th century"" that you realize that I WAS SARCASTIC.";negative
There is no way how to fight government, so rifles are pointless, because guess what... you cannot shot down rocket, drone or helicopter by rifle....;negative
I love this argument.;positive
So, you think I am safe from the government because they can vaporize me if they wanted to.;negative
I feel so safe.;positive
Let's look at the 20th century when the Nazis had gun control.;neutral

Nazi argument is really just another BS,,,;negative

Good, you don't understand English, we can ignore your opinion.;negative
If town A has 50 gun deaths and 50 knife deaths you would claim it is less safe than town B that has 30 gun deaths and 90 knife deaths.;negative

Again BS, US has 5x more murders (knife etc) than Japan and off course 199x more gun murders.;negative

Then imagine this country, and it's well-funded lobby of poisonous snake breeders and owners arguing that the high rate of fatal poisonous snake bites were due to (a) poor snake handling techniques, or (b) violent video games, or (c) drugs and urban gangs, or (d) some other ludicrous reason.;negative
Then imagine this same coalition of pro-poisonous snake owning lobbies went on TV and said the problem was insufficient poisonous snake ownership, or too many restrictions on poisonous snake ownership, or insufficient enforcement of existing laws around poisonous snake ownership.;negative
And then rubbishing studies that correlated high rates of poisonous snake ownership with high rates of fatalities due to poisonous snake bites.;negative

Banning guns in America only takes them away from one group:;neutral
Law-abiding citizens.;neutral
The military and police will keep their guns, of course.;positive
Criminals will still be able to get guns.;positive
Tech has reached a point where this is inevitable.;negative
The US has too much border to patrol to prevent illegal weapons imports.;negative
We already have a huge illegal weapons market within our borders!;negative
And don't forget that working firearms have been assembled using 3-D printers, or the fact that there are plans on the internet for constructing firearms using off the shelf parts at home depot and minimal tools- for a couple of the plans, a basic dremel tool has all of the attachments you'd need.;negative
Banning guns will make the illegal market larger and more profitable.;neutral
I'd expect more weapons to be smuggled in from Mexico, and even Canada to meet the demand.;negative
This is not a slight against Mexico or Canada in general, mind you, but a simple fact that there are greedy, unscrupulous individuals everywhere.;negative
The market would certainly be taken advantage of.;neutral
If homemade firearms become more common out of 'necessity,' the problem is compounded.;negative
Improvised weapons are already a problem in prison- imagine if knowledge on how to build a firearm from scratch became more common amongst criminals?;negative
Nice pile of shit ...just look around Europe .;negative
The Europe comparison is what, in fact, is a pile of shit.;negative
Europe is not at all comparable to the US in this regard for two main reasons.;neutral
First and foremost is the power the government holds vs the territory they have to enforce regulations upon.;positive
The United States represents a territory comparable to all of Europe combined.;positive
Gun enforcement represents a logistical nightmare at the federal level that nothing in all of Europe comes anywhere near to approaching.;negative
In order to be remotely comparable, we'd have to be comparing individual States within the US with nations in Europe, and that simply falls flat- from one end, our state governments have significantly less power and infrastructure to utilize said power than national governments in Europe do, and are further curtailed by the division of power between the state and federal governments.;negative
A categorical gun ban within the US would be all but impossible to enforce.;negative
Secondly is the culture (as well as criminal culture) within the regions.;negative
Already, with firearms being generally legal within the US, we have a significantly larger black market weapons trade within our borders, again, than all of Europe combined.;negative
Basic supply and demand applies here- there is simply more demand for firearms, legal or illegal, within the United States than there is within Europe.;negative
Banning guns will in fact increase the demand for illegal firearms, driving up prices and attracting further suppliers.;positive
This is not speculation, but extrapolation of what we've already seen within the few regions within the US where firearms are actually illegal (which amounts mainly to a handful of cities at current).;negative
In short, Europe is overall better equipped to regulate firearms than the US is due to enjoying both a lower demand for firearms and more potency within the government to police things at the local level.;negative
If you'd like to contest some of my points specifically, feel free to do so.;positive
But a one-off 'look at Europe' completely lacking in details and specifics does not dispute what I've asserted in any way.;negative
Europe is also a bad comparison because many of the nations in Europe have significantly more crime per capita than the United States do.;negative
Note 'Per Capita.';negative
"The graph in the link offers both; US is the highest in total number of crimes but also has a significantly larger population than the European nations.";positive
Disclaimer: Data in link is from 2002.;neutral
statistics are done per 100 000 people so the overall population does not matter.;negative

The 'Per Capita' chart is instances per 100,000 people as you assert, and the US is at #22 on that list, having less than half the total crime per capita that the UK has.;negative
Strict gun law does not equal less dead people.;negative
In fact, the areas within the US that have the strictest gun control laws have some of the highest gun crime rates- look at New York City, for example.;negative
The UK also has a comparable per capita murder rate to the US- they simply have far more murders committed with other weapons/means.;negative
I'm sure if you go looking high enough you could find an apples-to-apples comparison that supports your claim, but it's incredibly easy to find cases where your claim is unsupported.;negative
I appreciate the ideal you're going for, but it's simply not factual in reality.;neutral
I again request that you attempt to address my points- your most recent post still did not do that, just made some completely unbacked claims that don't really have a basis in reality, and an observation re: my data that indicates that you either did not read it or did not comprehend it properly.;negative

The LOWEST amongst these represents nearly triple the number of gun murders that you noted.;negative
If your overall murder rates are as far off as your gun murder rates are, adjusting for that puts UK more or less on par with the US.;negative
And this doesn't address the fact that the assault rate in the UK is nearly 4x that in the US.;negative
I wonder if that discrepancy has to do with the lethality of guns?;neutral
"You've made a pretty good case for keeping guns illegal in the UK at least; if the UK had the same gun laws and availability as the US, I'd expect they'd wipe themselves out to a man within a year.";positive

Any statement in support of banning guns is shortsighted and naive.;negative
IT WORKS EVERYWHERE;neutral
I gave you a list of years, and the number of recorded gun murders in the UK for each.;negative
The link shows this, in comparison to the overall gun rate.;positive
You do not provide a link to your source, nor do you even respond when I request what year they're referring to.;negative
All I have is your word regarding those sources, and that's not adding up too well.;negative
Yes, US has 5x more murder in general.;negative
We also have roughly 5x the population of the UK.;negative
And from the statistics I've linked, the US has around 100-300 times more total gun kills than the UK does on any given year- not 600.;negative
That works out to 30-60 times more gun kills per capita, which the UK makes up for in stabbings, etc.;negative
Only if you're willing to 1) ignore most cases and cherry-pick specific ones that support your position, 2) Bounce back and forth between per capita and total numbers when the one you're using suddenly doesn't support you anymore, and 3) Flatout lie where needed.;negative

I am glad you were treating me like you treat everyone when you completely ignored what I said.;negative
I am glad I am not a special case.;negative
You cannot compare general crime because that is state of law.;negative
Many things that are considered crime in the UK are not crime in the US...;negative
Why don't you compare murder rates?;negative
Gun kills?;negative
Last time I checked US had 600x more gunkills than UK...;neutral
"Comparing gun kills to gun kills isn't a valid comparison due to the relative availability of each; guns are more available in the US than they are in UK.";negative
Why don't we compare murder rates, then?;negative
Last I checked, the overall per capita murder rate in the UK was comparable to that of the US- just a lot more beatings, stranglings, and stabbings and a few less shootings.;positive
We need to ban being an asshole.;negative
That would prevent a lot of shootings.;neutral
That WOULD solve most of the world's problems.;negative

The right of mentally stable people to bear arms is a fundamental right.;positive
BS...crazy people have every right to defend themselves just as your fat ass does...but if they decide to cross the line, they should be punished accordingly.;negative
Ok I was with you until this.;positive
People that are unstable shouldn't be able to have guns.;negative
You say they should because its there right and if they go to far they will be punished but that is completely crazy!;neutral
So we will allow them to have guns but when they kill someone well then they can't have them YOU ARE INSANE!!;negative

Crime statistics on the internet are all over the place but for the most part the US stats per person are about the same to way less than that of the UK.;negative

Self defense.;neutral
I think gun control is good but gun control helps keep a balance for guns.;positive

and it is possible to get shot 10 times with a .22 and still break the neck of the shooter.;neutral
Assault rifles are single purpose devices, designed to kill as many people as possible, not to harm but to kill whole groups of people.;negative

Not practical for personal defence at all.;neutral
Just to let you know, this doesn't show you understand at all what an assault rifle is.;negative
There is no reason why random drunks should own assault weapons;negative
.22 handgun will protect anyone enough;neutral
There is obvious exception for former military, cops...;negative
This statement shows you are a fool.;negative
You went from banning people with mental conditions to people who like to drink alcohol.;neutral
That's a huge jump.;neutral
This shows that you can't be talked to.;neutral
You go from talking about assault weapons to only allowing a .22 handgun.;negative
Another huge jump.;neutral
How are we supposed to have a real discussion about gun control if nothing you say is connected?;neutral
Former cop shot guy in movie theater in Florida because he was playing with his phone.;negative
No, weapons are not chew toys.;neutral
It should not be held by irresponsible people, which drunks and retards clearly are.;negative
simply because .22 is enough, point of self defence is in defending yourself no to kill everybody around...;negative
f he was fired for being mentally fucked, he would not be given a right to carry weapon... which would prevent the shooting.;negative
There is no reason why civilians should be able to buy/own large calibres, large clips, silencers, special ammo or automatic weapons.;negative

A gun is a tool created for the sole purpose of ending the life of a life form that cannot be approached otherwise.;negative
Yes guns should be banned as the only thing a gun does is kill someone.It is pure evil.;negative
Guns kill people?;neutral
Show me a link of a gun so much as assaulting a person and I'll believe that.;positive
A gun is an inanimate object, a gun doesn't walk around shooting people on its own, there has to be a killer behind it.;negative
Also, might I add, that a global ban on guns (let alone a national ban) is not feasible at all.;negative
A gun has to be used to kill someone.;neutral
People kill others with knives, so are they going to bann knives next?;neutral
I don't think so.;neutral
You could more than likely kill anyone with just about anything.;negative
"That doesn't mean that it's ""pure evil"".";negative
Brilliant idea!;neutral
I hope such a movement will energize and the whole world can toss their guns away.;neutral
Would love to see who'd enforce that... and with what tools.;neutral
Also an excellent point.;positive
That's idiotic.;negative
Why on Earth should guns be banned?;negative
I assume by adding the worldwide aspect that you think it covered the people who get them illegally, but that's the thing.;negative
They get them illegally.;neutral
No, I don't think guns should be banned worldwide, militaries, and police need them to protect against others (most likely criminal) that will find a way to get the,;negative
It's just not a plausible scenario.;negative
As much as I would love to see guns and modern artillery abolished for more simple means of waging war honourably (sword shield, pike, lance, bow an arrow) it will not happen without every last gun being found, destroyed along with all records detailing one's manufacture.;negative
We will always be in possession of them.;neutral
The best we can hope for is ammo ceases to be manufactured rendering them all useless given time.;negative
And by no means should government try to disarm citizens.;negative
By historical standards this act is a step away from dictatorship and enslavement.;positive
should private gun ownership be prohibited?;neutral
I dont see why not because I dont see any downside to banning guns, other than it might be hard to enforce such a law in the USA, in the beginning at least;negative
"In the words of Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy, Chief Medical Officer of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701, ""Are you out of your Vulcan mind?""";negative
Much debate has gone on as to whether this entire classification of weapons should be removed from the market.;negative
Present your best argument for or against such moves to ban a popular weapon classification.;positive
I personally believe semi auto should be allowed in the firearm market because even with autoloaders restricted, tragedies like Newtown could have been pulled off with a double action revolver, quite easily.;negative
Plus, weapons like the Ruger 10/22, which is an autoloading repeater chambered for .22 LR, would be placed on the BATF's Title 2 Class 3 weapons list, which tend to get pricey.;negative
Face Palm... Where do I begin with this?;negative
Your right to keep and bear arms is not something that is balanced against a need to own them.;negative
It's better to have the means to defend yourself and not need it than to ever need it and not have it.;negative
We have the right to keep and bear arms (2nd Amendment) as a means to defend ourselves, our freedoms and our State's from (among other things) tyranny.;negative
Just as it was with the revolutionary war, if we (the people) are ever to face men with guns to defend ourselves, we would need at least the same kind of personal weapons that they (our oppressors) would have.;negative
For anything other than military purposes I'd say yes.;neutral
So, in a home invasion, your choice is the telephone rather than a semi automatic weapon.;negative
That is interesting.;positive
The invaders, if this ban were properly implemented, wouldn't have semi automatic weapons in the first place.;negative
Invaders don't need semi automatic weapons to break into a home, there are other weapons.;negative
Even so, criminals get weapons from the underground market, so the ban would prove to be pointless anyway.;negative
No ordinary citizen needs a semi automatic weapon.;negative
If you aren't police or military, why do you need it?;negative
Face Palm... Where do I begin with this?;negative
Your right to keep and bear arms is not something that is balanced against a need to own them.;negative

Okay, I'm not a gun guy.;negative
"I saw automatic and assumed he meant ""machine guns"".";neutral
I don't think machine guns should be allowed.;negative
I understand pistols, shotguns, and rifles.;positive
For defense.;neutral
Semi-automatic weapons are great for home defense as well as defending one's family.;positive
It is used for hunting purposes as well.;neutral
A minescule fraction of a percent of semi-auto weapons are used in a crime.;negative
More people die from table utensils than semi-auto.;negative
There is no reason to ban them.;negative
I thought semi auto were machine guns... just look at my response to Cartman and the other dude.;negative
Oh, okay.;positive
It can be confused easily.;negative
Still, fully-automatic weapons are legal and should stay that way, and they have been used in a crime twice since 1934 that involved a legally-owned full-auto.;negative
The problem is that they are very hard to get, expensive, and are taxed.;negative
Really, I don't see what the problem is of loosening up some regulations and allowing full-auto manufacture again.;negative
It would be the same as the current semi-auto weapons, but more fun!;positive
It's easier to obtain it illegally on the black market than legally.;negative
Seriously, I knew a guy who could get a full-auto AK illegally.;negative
He gave me a price too, though I declined for obvious reasons.;negative
But I can tell you it was cheaper.;positive
Bad guys have it, why can't good guys?;negative
Can you explain in your own words what semi automatic weapon means?;neutral
Which guns should be allowed?;negative
I'm not a gun guy.;negative
I was thinking of automatic guns (I guess), like machine guns.;negative
Pistols, rifles and shotguns should be allowed.;negative
I had that feeling.;neutral
It is a common mistake.;negative
I figured I could get that cleared up before yelling at you.;negative
Automatic guns will continuously fire until you let go of the trigger or run out of ammo.;negative
Semi automatic fires once.;neutral
You have to move your finger forward to reset the trigger, then you can fire again.;negative
Most pistols are semi automatic.;neutral
So, do you think fully automatic guns should be allowed?;negative
No.;neutral
Fully auto freaks me out, too.;negative
I have a perfect compromise that will satisfy both sides of whether or not semi automatic weapons should be banned.;positive
This is essentially an issue of rate of fire.;neutral
How long it takes to fire how many bullets.;neutral
The question is why does one need a semi auto gun?;neutral
The most important answer is for self-defense.;positive
It can take only one shot to defend against an attacker.;negative
But that one shot could miss.;negative
People have varying levels of shooting skill (read accuracy).;negative
Now one could have two or more guns to give them more chances to defend themselves.;neutral
But this is impractical.;negative
There is only one answer that makes sense and should satisfy all concerned (I say should because (believe it or not) some people can never be satisfied).;negative
Make semi automatic weapons that have cycle systems (essentially rate of fire) capable of being fine tuned.;neutral
This way an accurate shooter will have a weapon with a relatively slow rate of fire since they will, most likely, need fewer shots to defend themselves.;negative
I defy anyone to find a flaw in this system.;negative
Here are a few:;neutral
1) Guns are easy to take apart, so the parts that have been put into place might be able to be taken out and replaced with something that doesn't work that way.;neutral
2) You want gun manufacturers to build a product that is inferior, and you want to people who like the good stuff to settle for lower quality.;negative
3) What if there are multiple attackers and you are inaccurate?;neutral
What a terrible situation to be in.;negative
I might have more later.;neutral
Plus, it wouldn't be as fun to shoot.;negative
Controlled rate of fire makes it boring.;negative
It's true, I think the anti gun crowd is not as concerned that we have fun.;negative
Banning anything won't keep it off the streets so, to not waste my time, I'll just say no.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral

Some people think it should taken off or be changed because people misinterpret the 2nd amendment and that if its is changed, or even taken off, that the crime rates will drop incredibly.;negative
And others believe that it should be kept to itself and nothing should change about it.;negative
What do **YOU** think?;neutral
Having just won independence from an overbearing and abusive government, because citizens were armed, our forefathers purposefully created an amendment, protecting our God given right to keep and bare arms.;negative
They had the foresight to realize that the new government they were creating, may some day become overbearing and abusive.;negative
Our forefathers realized that, when in the course of events, the US government must be replaced, citizens must be armed for the occasion.;negative

All the gun nuts are running around raping and killing and the police can't do anything about it.;negative
Guns do nothing except spread injustice.;negative
If one looks at the wording in the second ammendmant, it could even mean having the right to wear sleeveless shirts or hang bear arms on their walls.;negative
all you conservatives should go back to your inbred holes and trailor parks to do some actual research.;negative
Are you even credited?;neutral
This is wrong on so many levels.;negative
First off all the people in the 1700's had the same IQ as we do today for example Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin both had an IQ of 160 and both were adamant supporters of the second amendment.;neutral
"Secondly there is no evidence that gun owners or ""gun nuts"" are any more dangerous than your average human.";negative
In countries where guns have been heavily restricted or banned there was no statistal drop in crime after the ban.;negative
Take Great Britain or Luxomborg both have some of the strictest gun laws in Europe and both have some of the highest violent crime rates in Europe.;neutral
And I see no reason why we shouldn't have the right to sleevless shirts personally.;negative
The Second Amendment should be removed from the Bill of Rights because it has no relevance to the 21st century.;negative
"You can take my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers ;)";neutral
The 2nd Amendment wasn't made so that rednecks could go hunting or so that people could shoot each other, it was made so that citizens could defend themselves against criminals and oppressive governments.;negative
"I find it amusing that the elitist actually ""believe"" they can take the ""right"" to bear arms from American Citizens by proclaiming guns, ammo etc. to be illegal.";positive
They seem to forget that a gun is nothing more than a tool / machine and many Americans have the ability to make crude guns with commonly found items and with the right set up can fabricate just about anything.;negative
People not accused of a crime should be able to buy anything.;negative
If their planning to cause a crime thats conspiracy to commit a crime, which is still a crime.;negative
And being that you cant accuse the entire country of conspiracy to commit a crime without looking like a horses ass, theres no point in even suggesting it.;negative
Oh, and dont assume i think the law gets it right all the time.;negative
Im just informing you of the legal procedure your trying to circumvent by amending someone elses bill of rights.;negative
i think the 2nd amendment is pretty clear in what it states: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsMaN7mdSWs;neutral
Sure if you want 1776 all over again.;negative
The right of mentally stable people to bear arms should never be infringed.;negative
2nd Admendment : Right for the people to keep and bear arms.;positive
In my opinion, it was good in the beginning for people to protect and defend themselves, but now this has caused an increase in violence.;negative
Or if you say that we should keep it, whould we put restrictions on what type of fire arms we should allow to the public?;neutral
This idea that gun rights increases violence is a bit unfounded.;negative
Some studies used against gun have been ones showing that over 50% of homicides in the US are committed with guns, while in countries with gun bans or very strict gun control have a lower amount of gun homicides.;negative
HOWEVER, just because a violent crime is done with a gun doesn't mean the guns being legal have CAUSED the homicide.;negative
Some Social Psychologists try to point to the idea that guns remove a bit of intimacy from killing another human being, which has some truth to it.;negative
It is far harder to stab a person to death than shoot them if you are not the killing type.;negative
So what does the data suggest about gun control?;neutral
According to justthefacts.org, guns are heavily used in areas that allow them.;negative
HOWEVER, gun bans and restrictions do not reduce homicide rates.;negative
They lower the percentage done by guns, but violent crime rates have spiked heavily in DC, Britain, and Chicago after enacting gun restrictions and bans.;negative
As for allowing citizens to carry a firearm, Florida had a significant decrease in murder rates, while Texas and Michigan had a minor decrease.;negative
Despite the facts, some still try to argue for gun control or tight restrictions, including the idea that guns lead to fatal accidents.;negative
However, there is no evidence to suggest that the amount of accidents outweigh the amount of defenses.;neutral
In fact, fatal gun accidents only account for about .5% of the total fatal accidents in the United States.;negative
This is something to greatly consider especially since the US is greatly criticized for having generally laxed gun laws.;negative
The Second Amendment itself was put in place not just to have the citizens to defend themselves when government can't, but to keep the population armed and dangerous in case the government ever overstepped its bounds.;negative
The Founding Fathers never dreamed of a Utopia where violence would no longer be necessary.;negative
In fact, they figured that it would be very necessary at times.;neutral

You've responded to none of my post.;negative
----------------------------------------------------------;neutral
not really sure what are you talking about .;negative
There has been a lot of blood shed in the history of the developments of the English and Japanese governments.;positive
I don't know where you got the idea there wasn't any blood shed in the formation of those countries.;negative
who is talking about their formation?;neutral
I was talking about present, guns are banned in both countries and no massacres happen.;negative
If anything, the increase in violence is due to the the incessant gun control laws, and the lack of protection in the 2nd Amendment.;negative
All signs point to the increase of government reliance on security rather than private protection.;negative
When guns are taken out of the hands of private citizens and increased power granted to the government, police state and tyrants always ensue.;negative
Revoked completely?;neutral
No, certainly not.;neutral
But in reality the 2nd Amendment already doesn't live up to its terms: not everyone can get a firearm and not all firearms are allowed.;negative
I think that having restrictions on the 2nd Amendment, like we already do, is the best possible way to regulate it while still allowing people the freedom to own weapons.;positive
Making owning a gun illegal will not deter someone prepared to use a gun illegally to kill someone.;negative
It might make them harder to acquire, but there's already nothing you cant get on the black market, so all you'd really be doing in revoking the 2nd is unbalance the playing field by allowing criminals to have guns but not the law abiding citizens upon whom they prey.;negative
Guns should be able to be used in ways of self defense and in hunting;neutral
Absolutely not!;neutral
The vast majority of gun violence in America is caused by people who have guns illegally and punishing people who choose to have them legally is not going to stop the violence.;negative
Maybe if we actually punished the criminals for their choices we could discourage bad behavior, just a thought.;negative

No it shoudnt because Americans need a way to protect themselves from their enemies.;negative
Every one who thinks the 2nd amendment should be remove are retarded we need guns for protection food hunting sport and everything else I mean it is just stupid how people think they should be changed.;negative
when that amendment was written they only had muskets but the were state of the art of that time so they intended for people to own these type of weapons and all guns;neutral
All I gotta say is that this is complete BS, the need to use because they have them that's what the range is for.;negative
Absolutely not!;neutral
The vast majority of gun violence in America is caused by people who have guns illegally and punishing people who choose to have them legally is not going to stop the violence.;negative
Maybe if we actually punished the criminals for their choices we could discourage bad behavior, just a thought.;negative
If anything, the increase in violence is due to the the incessant gun control laws, and the lack of protection in the 2nd Amendment.;negative
All signs point to the increase of government reliance on security rather than private protection.;negative
When guns are taken out of the hands of private citizens and increased power granted to the government, police state and tyrants always ensue.;negative
The 2nd Amendment of the Constitution should be revoked because many people have these guns in their possession and many use it as a means of settling a situation.;negative
Also, guns inplicate the need to use it, same as people who smoke and have cigarrettes in their possession feel the need to smoke.;negative
Lastly, in today's world, why should a gun be brought into a situation?;negative
The moment the trigger is pulled, someone's life can be taken away.;negative
All I gotta say is that this is complete BS, the need to use because they have them that's what the range is for.;negative
You have a point.;neutral
People might have a pack of smokes on hand and in a time of need use them.;neutral
Likewise, someone might have a gun on hand and should someone breaks into his/her home the gun might be used.;negative

Guns create this effect.;positive
Someone might bring a gun into a crowded place but if that person knew that say 10% of the people had guns, he/she would look for a different target.;negative
Soft targets are more responsible for murder and death then guns.;negative
A killer goes in a house with a knife, why, because he has profiled the place and has assumed that the person would not have a gun.;negative
Maybe not even a knife, but some sleeping agent.;neutral
"Cars and ""legal drugs"" kill far more people then guns.";negative
And often with intent, but usually when someone is murdered with a car the victim isn't in a car but on foot.;negative
Again, the issue is the soft target.;neutral
More rarely, when someone kills with a car, they don't risk hitting a moving car, because of AMD.;negative
About 50% of people killed with guns do it themselves.;negative

BUT, there is no reason in today's society for the average person to have assault weapons and even handguns in their homes.;negative
The 2nd Amendment talks about a well regulated militia, are you part of a militia?;negative
no, you're not.;negative
Are you well regulated?;neutral
(this includes being trained and maintained) No, probably not.;negative
Do you understand that the protection was originally intended for the types of weapons that were not used in the military, so that hunters and the like could still hunt?;negative
The type of militia they spoke of was basically the national guard of its time.;neutral
If you are in the guard, great, good for you, if not then you are just waiting for an accident to happen, or waiting for your opportunity to hurt someone else, either way you are wrong.;positive
The fact of the matter is...stupid people shouldn't be able to have guns.;negative
And the very fact that those of us of ~superior~ intelligence can now PRINT GUNS, using 3D printers...well shit, let's disarm all the lessers!;positive
LOL;neutral
It's a matter of natural selection as I see it...the intellectually INFERIOR will have no guns...and those of us of technical superiority...well, we can use 3D printers to make as many guns as we like!;positive

"PSP, Game Boy, Atari, 5 1/4"" floppies?";negative
And one that is so bright about modern technology, surely you have read up on controlling, predicting, and causing earthquakes, right?;positive
We can predict and cause earthquakes, and working on the tech to control them.;positive
There is nothing wrong in debating gun control.;negative
At the very least, it's educational, something obviously you don't need.;positive
"So now you know that we can ""strongly influence earthquakes"" (control is too strong a word for anything) what can you put in your pants and scratch next?";negative
There is too much gun violence in America.;negative
The Second Amendment should be revoked.;negative
There isn't good reason for anybody to own assault weapons or any other weapon capable of extreme murder.;negative
Sure, guns may be fun to play with at home, but if safety for people is to be more insured, then that is unimportant.;negative
Military and other government-type organizations are the only people who should be allowed to use these.;negative

"Are the laws currently strict enough, and you agree that it's the ""people"" not the ""guns that cause violence?";negative
Or do the laws need to be stricter- should we keep guns out of people's hands?;neutral
They should but the probably won't.;negative
Obviously there should be refined versions of the 2nd Amendment.;negative
Why shouldn't there be?;negative
"People are obviously not in a position to frankly state ""We will not to anything stupid with the right to bear arms.""";negative

You know why there are so few Islamic terrorists attacking America?;neutral
Because you guys are doing the job for them.;positive
How to kill the most Americans?;neutral
Sell them cheap hamburgers and make more guns available to them.;negative
If they don't eat themselves into an early grave, they'll just start shooting at one another.;negative
Fact: based on studies conducted by the CDC and DOJ guns are 4 times more likely to be used in self defense, 89% of the Time firing the weapon isn't needed just showing your would be assailant the business end is enough to defuse the situation.;negative
Your move libtard;neutral
In the United States alone, guns are the most common out of all weaponry including knives, switchblades, cars etc as the weapon in murders.;negative
America, despite being a developed country, ranked 26th in the world in number of murders in which the murder weapon was a gun.;negative
Many say that it's the murderer, not the weapon who should be looked upon, and that a gun on its own cannot do any harm until it's in someone's hands.;negative
But see the reason why these weapons of mass destruction can even get into these people's hands are due to loose laws on gun possession.;negative
tighten the laws, and the numbers will surely go down.;negative
right now, in the US, background checks are rarely done in more than 40% of gun sales, since most people buy from relatives/friends.;negative
so yes, the laws should be tightened.;neutral
Yes there should be.;neutral
There should be laws allowing for a psychological examination of the person who is applying for firearm possession because many of the heinous crimes committed by firearm owners are committed by mentally disturbed people.;neutral
Real strict laws are needed in order to stop this excessive gun violence.;neutral
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral

It might be time for people on both sides of the issue to at least entertain the notion that maybe the legal status of guns does not actually have direct significant correlation with violent crime, and rather than fiddling with our laws, maybe look at making mental health treatment easier to acquire, and making prisons more affective at rehabilitation and deal with other issues that have a stronger correlation with the problem.;negative
Why is createdebate always about America.;neutral

I don't own a gun and I've never fired one, but I am a huge supporter of gun rights.;negative
Self-defense is a inherent right that all of us have and removing one's ability to defend themselves is something I find morally repugnant.;positive
Besides it's incredibly difficult and expensive to regulate restricting gun laws in the US.;negative
It's practically impossible given the large number of gun owners and the tragedy of it all is that it would accomplish nothing.;negative
Law abiding citizens will give up their guns and the one's who intend to use guns for malicious intent won't.;positive
Such a law will not deter criminals.;negative
Government laws don't make us more civilized, if anything we become less civilized through the act of force and less voluntary actions.;negative
For one thing, without the right to own guns, WHAT IS THE MILITARY SUPPOSED TO USE?!;negative
Will we even HAVE a military?;neutral
Now that I've covered that,, let me bring up something...;neutral
EVER HEARD OF THE BLACK MARKET?!;negative
You know, this is an idea I had beforehand aswell.;negative
The black market makes a convenient reason to not restrict gun laws.;negative
If the people are going to get them anyway, why ban them?;negative
Sensible logic^;neutral
But, when you think a little farther ahead, members of the Black Market don't sell weapons to people they don't know anyway.;negative
Loose lips sink ships and the Black Market is a very LARGE ship.;negative
When firearms are banned in America, those restrictions are only going to get tighter.;negative
With firearms legal, they can get in a little trouble and go to jail for a bit.;negative
With firearms banned, they will get in quit a bit of trouble, and may never see freedom again.;negative
Nobody reasonable likes to be incarcerated.;positive
That's the base line of it.;neutral
And the people who sell the guns, believe it or not, are reasonable businessmen who saw an area for profit outside the constricts of the law.;negative
They know that if they get caught, there will be severe repercussions for their work, however, they operate quietly and cover their tracks.;negative
Obviously, guns will still get through.;neutral
Without a complete totalitarian regime, nothing can be stamped out completely.;negative
The point is, that you will not be able to find a gun at wal-mart just because your wife fucked another guy.;negative
Without guns in the homes, the deranged people who shoot up schools because they were bullied at some point will not have easy access to their guns and they will probably slip out of their dangerous mental state before they can act on their aggression.;negative
Obviously, this will not stop the killers who plan carefully in advance, gather their resources via previosuly existing black market connections and carry out attacks.;negative
But we've never been able to stop those people before they strike, so it is essentially a moot point.;negative
The violence won't disappear of course, but it will be reduced.;neutral
The military would be exempted from that rule, i would imagine, but would have to check their firearms at an armoury before leaving the base.;negative
I have no idea if that is the current practice in america or not, as I don't live there.;negative
but, that is how a third party views it.;positive
The right to own guns was created so it could apply during the times of war when every male civilian could have been drafted to serve in the war.;negative
So yes, the military is excluded from this group because the amendment was created to preserve the ability of the military.;negative
And you are right.;positive
The black market will always exist but let me ask you another question.;neutral
Should we allow rapists to continue raping simply because they will do it anyways?;neutral
If you are suggesting that we should not place stricter laws on gun possession simply because it will still take place through the black market, then you reason is flawed for a surety.;negative
Id say no.;neutral
.;neutral
First of all, guns wouldnt have any use without people using it.;neutral
They'd just stay on wherever you put them because they cant walk.;negative
Therefore, it is only up to the people if they would have a use for that object.;negative
Second, I'd like to say that they shouldnt put any more strict rules about gun possession.;neutral
More strict laws, therefore, more people would want to violate it.;negative
The gun is a symbol.;neutral
It is a symbol of a human desire to kill efficiently.;negative
Owning a gun makes people feel safe.;neutral
Why?;negative
Because there is no living thing in the world that you can not kill with a gun.;negative
Someone robs a house, the residents come home mid robbery.;neutral
What's the rationale of someone who doesn't own a gun?;neutral
"""I'll call the authorities and they will come and solve the problem.""";neutral
Either the authorities or the sound of the sirens scare off the would be robber.;negative
What's the rationale of someone who owns a gun?;neutral
"""I'm going to go kill them and solve the problem.""";negative
Either the robber or the man who goes in dies.;negative
The top one ensures the continued life of the homeowners.;positive
When anyone can have a gun, it is a more dangerous world.;negative
The ability to kill someone at the pull of a trigger is not something any man should have.;negative
"The average response time to a code 3 call for service is 30 minuets burglary is a Code 2 (less important) criminals don't wait that long by the time the authority's arrive to ""fix"" the situation the burglar has already robbed you blind and depending on the situation you might be dead and you wife or daughter might have been raped.";negative
The gun is a symbol.;neutral
It is a symbol of a human desire to kill efficiently.;negative
Who says?;neutral
And where did you get that fact?;neutral
or opinion?;neutral
Oh yes, it makes people feel safe.;positive
But not all things in the world can be killed with a gun.;neutral
Apparently, you'd be able to kill someone if you shoot them in a vital organ or artery, but if you dont, then they wouldnt die.;negative
Also they could be killed if you shot a living thing many times.;neutral
Apparently, if you shoot a starfish, it could self generate and create a new tentacle(if thats what you call it).;negative
.;neutral
as long as you dont shoot a vital organ of it.;negative
Yeah theyd call the authorities.;neutral
.;neutral
that would be better.;neutral
But, what if the burglar does something bad to you?;neutral
You use it for self defense.;neutral
You use the gun not for attacking, but just to defend yourself.;negative
Thats what I was saying.;neutral
Besides, authorities would come and the burglars would escape, not be caught by the authority.;negative
Therefore, robbers could do more attacks on other people.;negative
No, what do you really think of all people huh?;neutral
Killers?;negative
Come on.;neutral
Some people would even get a license for the gun and just keep it at home, and not take it out of their house.;negative
Theyd just use it for defense.;neutral
The robber would most likely be not killed because they himself have their own set of guns.;negative
Policemen would likely be killed, because they are armed too.;negative
Then, the owner of the house will not do anything bad, as long as the burglar doesnt hurt them.;negative
No it doesnt.;neutral
What makes you so sure that policemen would do their job so well, with arresting these people?;positive
Besides, burglars will not go home without a fight, therefore, they would likely be engaging in a shootout.;negative
And it would lead to more deaths.;negative
I did not say that anyone can have a gun.;negative
Of course, children should not be given guns, and only responsible people should be given.;negative
Besides, the debate is about the stricter laws that should be imposed on guns, not TOTAL GUN BAN.;negative
If it wasn't made of the desire to kill someone more efficiently, then it would not exist.;negative
The gun's only stated purpose is to kill things more efficiently.;negative
Symbols have no meaning without people to support them.;negative
Guns have no use without people to fire them.;negative
I'd say, while the two words are not mutually inclusive, you can see that anyone can make the observation that a gun is a symbol.;positive
A symbol of power, or manhood, aggression, whatever.;negative
But at it's basic purpose, it is a symbol and a tool of murder.;negative
With your whole argument invalidating my statement that there are no living things in this world that can't be killed by a gun, you didn't even disprove my statement.;negative
putting conditions on the survival of the thing being shot proves that it, in fact, CAN be killed.;negative
I didn't say that shooting a gun at something does, always, under every circumstance, kill it.;negative
I said they CAN be killed.;neutral
Also, Guns cannot be used for self defense against other guns.;negative
In order to defend yourself, you'd have to be attacked and before you can respond to the attack, you'll be dead.;negative
SO you have to shoot first.;neutral
That makes you a murderer.;neutral
(assuming killshot accuracy from both parties);neutral
I think that anyone given the opportunity to kill, the means to kill and the rage necessary to ignore their consciences will kill.;neutral
Guns make that murder too easy to commit.;negative
Having your home broken into and stolen from is enough for many people to lose that control.;negative
Then, the gun becomes a tool for revenge and we have a new murderer.;neutral
How do you objectively determine responsibility?;neutral
You can't.;neutral
What a responsible gun owner is to you is not to someone else.;negative
Personally, there are no responsible gun owners in my opinion.;negative
Owning a tool created to kill is not a responsible thing to do.;negative
What if it should misfire?;negative
What if it is stolen?;neutral
What if your child thinks it's a toy when you forgot to lock it up.;neutral
Humans are not infallible and knowing that, I can not responsibly own a gun.;negative
"Everyone knows the phrase ""Shit happens"", with guns involved, it gets bloody.";negative
Without a gun, these dangers do not exist.;negative
And yes, you're right.;positive
I got into a frenzy and lost sight of the topic.;neutral
It happens when a passion is ignited in your heart as I'm sure most people around here know.;negative
I mean, that's why we're all here, right?;negative
To share our passion for the things that matter to us?;neutral
To hope that our ignorance can be dissolved and that we too can dissolve the ignorance of others?;neutral
Nope.;neutral
Usually, people form the police dont use the gun just to kill someone.;negative
As we can see, they just use it to immobilize the other person and to capture the criminal.;negative
They only shoot the person in the head of they had NO OTHER CHOICE.;negative
Symbols have no meaning without people to support them.;negative
I'd say, while the two words are not mutually inclusive, you can see that anyone can make the observation that a gun is a symbol.;positive
Thats obvious already, people are the only beings on this planet who can reason out and tell the purpose of the gun.;negative
"It;'s obvious that animals only live by instinct, unlike people who think that everything has a use.";negative
Can you find any scientific study that whatever you are saying is true?;neutral
Not just internet websites because obviously those can be altered.;negative
I wasnt planning to disprove your statement when I gave my statement.;negative
I was trying to give other examples of living things that cant be killed immediately by a gun.;negative
Of course everything in this world could be killed, because, at some point in its life, it will wither and die.;negative
All of us are mortal and in fact, we dont need a gun to kill us efficiently.;neutral
Uh not really.;negative
If someone threw you a knife, and at the same time, you shot him 'because of your reflexes.;negative
.;neutral
then you dodged the gun.;neutral
.;neutral
then you're clearly not dead, but the other person is.;negative
Therefore, you were not the one who attacked first, and that is not considered as murder.;negative
Yeah, it makes murder easy to commit.;neutral
But dont forget that not everyone would immediately kill someone.;negative
That's quite insane if you just shot someone.;negative
Of course the owner of the house is scared.;neutral
It could even lead to trauma.;negative
Not all people would do revenge.;negative
Considering that they also have their own principles.;neutral
And they dont even know who the burglar is, so how would they even fond them.;negative
Unless, your family is part of the police.;neutral
Yeah.;neutral
Its also obvious that people are subjective.;neutral
We are the only ones who give those principles and rules as to what is moral or immoral.;negative
Let me get that back to you.;neutral
What an irresponsible GUN owner to you is responsible for someone else.;negative
Yeah.;neutral
Thats just your opinion.;neutral
We both have our opinions.;neutral
Thats why people are subjective.;negative
And they only judge base on what they see on their environment.;neutral
Maybe in your environment there are a lot of people who would just do murder.;neutral
But in my place, no.;negative
Actually, a lot of people die here not because of guns but because of starvation.;negative
Thats not primarily my problem here in our country.;neutral
As to your other statement about the irresponsible owner of the gun.;neutral
Well, what if there is a knife in the kitchen, and accidently the child got it, and didnt know what it was and he killed himself?;negative
Thats also irresponsible parenting.;negative
You cant just blame the gun owners for that.;negative
yeah, me too.;negative
Actually I have no idea what I am typing right now, cause I was thinking of a lot of words, and I cant put that in one single thought.;negative
In my perspective, thats what matters.;positive
The safety of the other people in here, who depend on the police, who use a gun, in order to defend themselves.;negative
HELL NO.;neutral
People need guns for protection.;neutral
Police don't protect people that isn their job a cops job is to make an area safer by removing dangerous individuals form the rest of the population.;negative
Only YOU can ASSURE YOUR safety.;negative
If a cop is present at the place and at the time that an incident is occurring he WILL help you but the problem is there's no guarantee there will always be a cop right there.;negative
Especially considering how criminals though really dumb are usually smart enough to make sure no one els is around before robbing, mugging, murdering, or rapeing someone.;negative
Maybe a more important question is would you take up arms that have been taken by the government to defend your freedom and your rights in the case of our government turning totalitarian?;negative
Violence certainly never solves anything but a gun in the hands of any human being does symbolize some sort of violence... war wouldn't solve anything it would only cause more devastation take our own Civil War for that matter!;negative
Outlawing guns will not help.;negative
For one thing a law will not keep them out of criminals hands.;negative
Just look at Mexico.;neutral
Some of the strictest gun laws in the world and the worst violence.;negative
If it did keep guns off the streets well then what?;neutral
The FBI says baseball bats are one of the most common deadly weapons.;negative
You don't need a gun to kill someone.;neutral
no because of the second amendment and if they do there will most likely be a second civil war;neutral
Would you take up arms because the government was trying to make america a safer place?;neutral
Irrelevant.;neutral
Gun control dose not actually make people safer.;negative
Look at mexico they have gun control laws, Australia has seen a 30% spike in violent crime since enacting their gun laws.;negative
And when DC had their hand gun ban their murder rate SPIKED as the murder rate for the rest of the country where no such ban was in effect fell.;negative

I said they CAN be killed.;neutral
Also, Guns cannot be used for self defense against other guns.;negative
In order to defend yourself, you'd have to be attacked and before you can respond to the attack, you'll be dead.;negative
SO you have to shoot first.;neutral
That makes you a murderer.;neutral
(assuming killshot accuracy from both parties);neutral
I think that anyone given the opportunity to kill, the means to kill and the rage necessary to ignore their consciences will kill.;neutral
Guns make that murder too easy to commit.;negative
Having your home broken into and stolen from is enough for many people to lose that control.;negative
Then, the gun becomes a tool for revenge and we have a new murderer.;neutral
How do you objectively determine responsibility?;neutral
You can't.;neutral
What a responsible gun owner is to you is not to someone else.;negative
Personally, there are no responsible gun owners in my opinion.;negative
Owning a tool created to kill is not a responsible thing to do.;negative
What if it should misfire?;negative
What if it is stolen?;neutral
What if your child thinks it's a toy when you forgot to lock it up.;neutral
Humans are not infallible and knowing that, I can not responsibly own a gun.;negative
"Everyone knows the phrase ""Shit happens"", with guns involved, it gets bloody.";negative
Without a gun, these dangers do not exist.;negative
And yes, you're right.;positive
I got into a frenzy and lost sight of the topic.;neutral
It happens when a passion is ignited in your heart as I'm sure most people around here know.;negative
I mean, that's why we're all here, right?;negative

Guns should be banned.;neutral
Guns serve no real positive purpose in life other than to kill people - which isn't a good thing unless that person is really annoying.;negative
I don't know why someone would need a gun unless they were in the forces because if all guns were banned then using guns for protection (the purpose, I believe) would be unnecessary for whoever was causing you to defend yourself wouldn't have a gun either, and therefore you are less likely to be hurt as badly.;negative
The reason that more gun robberies are in America than in any other country is strongly linked with the fact that in America people are allowed to have guns.;negative
If someone wanted home defence without the risk of killing someone then they could have a BB gun or paintball gun, for these are at lot less likely to kill people, however for some reason people feel the need to use real guns, and this is completely unnecessary!;negative
Guns hurt people and without them the world would be a safer, better place.;negative
The logic of this argument is not sound.;negative
People kill people with many different tools other than guns.;neutral
The fact is guns are tools.;neutral
Therefore, they have many positive purposes such as competitions, to provide food, to provide defense, to provide enjoyment, and others.;positive
This does not negate the fact that they can be used in a negative way.;negative
Banning guns does not guarantee that guns will not end up in a person's hand who wishes to cause harm or commit crimes.;negative
"So banning guns because you think the 'only' purpose is ""to kill people"" and it will keep them from criminal are narrow-minded perspectives.";negative
Secondly, the amount of guns in a society does not determine crime or murder rate.;negative
"One cannot state that ""the world would be a safer, better place"" just because there are no guns.";negative
The referenced statement makes the assumption that the majority of violence is caused by the mere presence of guns and ignores the fact that violence is caused by the human holding the gun.;negative
The world would be a safer place if people were less violent with each other.;neutral
If guns were gone, not just banned, I quite sure that people in this era would find other ways of being violent.;negative
Another fact is that I am more safe with a gun and training to use that gun when facing someone who is using a gun against me.;negative
The final humorous fact is that when zombies attack you will wish you had a gun, or two.;positive
Guns are very commonly used tools for violence in America.;negative
Therefore the amount of guns there are does impact on the amount of violence, so yes, it does impact on the amount of crime and muder rate.;negative
The world would be a safer, better place without guns.;negative
What good do they do?;positive
Have guns ever saved a life without having to take one?;neutral
No!;neutral
Guns kill people, and that is what they are largely designed to do.;negative
Admittedly, the very presence of the gun isn't wholly negative, but irresponsible people will be irresponsible with weapons of death, and what tool do they use?;negative
Guns.;neutral
If the government outlawed guns and successfully enforced the fact that people cannot have them, you wouldn't be approached by someone with a gun, because the gun wouldn't be there.;negative
The world would be safer without guns.;neutral
In what way does having guns on this planet save lives without taking any unless defying the purpose they were created for?;negative
There is none.;negative
True but the criminal would just replace a gun for a knife which they would use more willingly because they wont be afraid to use it in fear of killing someone.;negative
I feel that they would, however, be less confident with a knife than with a gun, and therefore some percentage of the problem will have been eliminated.;negative
I agree that this tool is commonly used in causing violence.;negative
However, this tool IS also used to prevent violence.;neutral
You are confusing the user with the tool.;negative
"Banning guns will not stop violence; it will only shift what tools are used to cause violence.";negative
Absolutely!;neutral
"Here is one example that proves your answer of ""No"" is incorrect:";neutral
http://www.abc4.com/content/news/top_stories/story/conceal-and-carry-stabbing-salt-lake-city-smiths/NDNrL1gxeE2rsRhrWCM9dQ.cspx;neutral
It has nothing to do with being irresponsible.;negative
It is about people being violent or committing crimes.;neutral
When people are violent they use all sorts of tools as weapons, not just guns: hammers, bats, sticks, cars, knives, shovels, pens, drain cleaner, rocks, etc.;negative
If you cannot see the truth in that then I think you are isolating guns because of some stigma or perspective you have against that particular tool.;negative
Case in point: Prison.;neutral
The only guns in prisons are carried by the officers.;negative
Yet, there are prisoners who find ways to cause injury and death with tools other than guns.;negative
How is prison safer for prisoners without guns?;neutral
It is not, because violence has nothing directly to do with guns and everything to do with people.;negative
To me your statement implies a total police state.;negative
Guns are only regulated now and law enforcement struggles with enforcing the current laws because it has nothing to do with the items that are banned/regulated.;negative
Enforcement will always be a struggle whether an item is banned or only regulated as long as we have freedom and some people choose to abuse that freedom.;negative
Moron.;neutral
Clearly you do not live near any dangerous animals, or gun ranges for that matter.;negative
There are many uses for guns which do not in any way shape or form involve killing people.;neutral
YOU can try to negotiate with a bear, or a coyote eyeing your kids or a rabid wolf if you want, I'm going to shoot if they pose a threat and there is no safe haven for everyone in the area.;negative
However, people are also killed with bat, knives, plastic bags, fists and feet, and even motor vehicles.;negative
Should we ban all of these things that you personally don't have a need for?;negative
Okay, this is even dumber that the 1st quote.;negative
Do you think for a minute a criminal gives a rat's ass about whether or not his gun is legal?;neutral
Not to mention that anyone with metalworking ability can construct a functional zipgun in under 20 minutes with access to the right equipment and, these do not even have to rely on conventional bullets.;negative
I mean.;neutral
.;neutral
honestly?;positive
Someone (excuse these crude themes) comes in to your home and wants to rape and murder your family, and you want to shoot them with a paint gun?;negative
They'll take their real gun that they got illegally got and they'll shoot you in the head.;positive
Guns don't kill people, people make the choice to kill people.;negative
Oh, and can you answer this?;positive
: Why is the government allowed to have every single type of weapon on this planet, and we are now having restrictions placed on owning handguns?;negative
What, is the government a completely benevolent and wonderful cause that only looks out for us?;positive
Are we too stupid to own guns?;negative
At the end of the day, people will get guns illegally if they're banned.;negative
The only people that won't have them are the honest people who won't buy them illegally.;neutral
If the government can enforce a ban then you will not be approached with anyone holding a gun.;negative
If someone were approaching me with a paintball gun then I wouldn't be too keen on getting hit - it isn't one of my priorities.;negative
I don't think you understand.;neutral
Criminals will get guns regardless of if they're illegal or not.;neutral
I mean, come on... What will happen is this: you'll have a BB gun and a criminal will come into your house with a real gun and you'll be dead.;negative
Yes....and no.;neutral
There are some guns necessary, and I feel relevant.;positive
A hunting rifle used for just that, hunting, and for ranchers for example protecting livestock from predators is fine.;negative
I am not a hunter, but I do understand that many people still use this as a resource for their food, and as a means to keep overpopulation down so that disease isnt spread etc.;negative
Having said that, I also think that there is absolutely no reason for there to be a handgun in every home.;negative
Guns are made to kill.;neutral
that is their only job.;neutral
they are not like a knife that absolutely could kill, but has its function based in utility, not in death.;negative
Guns are only made to end a life (whether human or animal).;negative
I think that without having guns around you not only eliminate the accidental deaths associated, but also the intentional harm done with them.;negative
What would the outcome be if a person walked into a store intending on robbing it but now they are armed only with a club or knife.;negative
could they cause harm?;neutral
of course.;neutral
but with the ease of a gun.;positive
.;neutral
absolutely not.;positive
"I have heard over and over again the argument ""what if someone breaks into your home to harm you, you'd want a gun then"" this is a fear tactic argument at best.";negative
if you dont have a gun (and based on an effective plan to eliminate guns) they would not have any either, and statistically you would be more apt to survive.;negative
"I have heard that ""if you outlaw guns only outlaws would have them"" this would be true without the effective plan to eliminate them, but given time and the willingness to learn to live in a society without having readily available firearms, it would eventually come around to where no one had them.";negative
I think that when you are arguing a problem you have to look at both sides, and the pros of outlawing guns outweighs the cons in every sense.;negative
Of course they should do that.;neutral
Just look what is happening right now and you won't have such questions anymore.;positive
I don't think that there is another way to fix this horrible situation.;negative
I have been through the whole content of this blog which is very informative and knowledgeable stuff, So i would like to visit again.;positive

Another great post, I appreciate all the work you put into this site, helping out others with your fun and creative works;positive
Yes, ban all guns except rifles that are single shot, that can only carry 2 bullets.;negative
You can't hide them in your pocket, you can still hunt, you can still shoot at targets, and you have to take time to reload... preventing easy mass murder.;negative
Well this is very interesting indeed.Would love to read a little more of this.;positive
admire the valuable information you offer in your articles.;positive

Guns are evil and the Government should outlaw them.;negative
A gun in the hands of a deranged person is horrible.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
Yeah, ban them.Yeah, ban them.Yeah, ban them.Yeah, ban them.Yeah, ban them.Yeah, ban them.;negative
This is not an intelligent argument.;negative
You are not stating why banning guns is a good idea or what it might accomplish.;negative
I totall agree.;neutral
Yeah, ban them.Yeah, ban them.Yeah, ban them.Yeah, ban them.;negative
Yepp, don't see how legalizing something, specifically designed for killing and hurting can do any good.;negative
Lets just wait for all the haters to comment something racist or anti-Muslimist!;negative
I despise stupidity, that is as close to hate as you will get.;negative
If you are so against any type of killing you had best be one of those granola chewing vegan that fail to recognize they too kill animals (in a slow painful way such as starvation) by causing habitat to be destroyed to feed their ill informed selves.;negative
Or, if i am a meat eater, which i am.;neutral
I will also realize the slow painful death that is caused when cows aren't stunned first before being killed.;negative
That millions of chickens are killed off everyday, and that they die an even painfuller slower death > Yes i realize this, but there is not much that can be done presently.;negative
However, the illegalization of guns so so much simpler, and can save at least a feq human lives.;neutral
You must really hate yourself.;negative
You are agreeing with yourself?!;neutral
What a load of crap!;negative
Furthermore, this is not an intelligent comment.;negative
No.;neutral
The last thing we need is another government restriction of our rights.;negative
Robberies and murders and assaults are perpetrated by criminals.;negative
Criminals will always have guns.;positive
Most guns used in crimes are already banned.;negative
That does not stop the criminals.;negative
Illegal handguns are flooding high crime areas.;negative
A gun is only potentially harmful.;negative
A gun in the hands of a responsible citizen is innocuous.;negative
As the saying goes, only outlaws will have guns.;negative
There are other things that are banned that are inherently harmful and still they persist.;negative
Such as drugs, sexual assault, child molesting, and so on.;negative
We need to address a multitude of social problems that are much more harmful and prevalent than guns.;negative
While many criminals have guns illegally, certainly not most.;neutral
And for those who have them illegally, they get them from legal sources, most commonly gun shows.;negative
If no guns were sold period, there would be far less of them.;negative
Sure, they may order one from another country, but the percent of criminals who would do this is very low, as we see in countries which do ban handguns, and which subsequently have far, far fewer instances of guns being used in crimes of any sort.;negative
"In addition, in reality your ""regular citizen"" is doing a piss poor job of ""protecting themselves"" with their guns anyway.";negative
All things fair in a standoff, criminals are generally more apt to fire accurately.;negative
If your house is being robbed by someone with a gun, they are less likely to shoot you if you don't shoot at them first.;negative
Gun owners accidently shoot themselves, family members, and innocent by-standers far more often then they shoot criminals.;negative
"You are very misinformed about gun shows; your statement makes it sound like you have never been to one nor do you know about state laws.";negative
I'm sure this varies slightly state to state, but in Utah in order to buy a gun at a gun show you must fill out the papers to purchase the firearm just as you would if you purchased the firearm from a gun store: background checks and waiting periods still apply.;negative
"You are incorrect that you think criminals are ""more apt.""";negative
The accuracy of the user largely depends on training.;negative
If a criminal has never fired their gun, then they are not going to be more accurate than a defending citizen who has never fired their gun.;negative
"The one angle I will give a criminal is that some of them will be more willing to pull the trigger because of their mindset; not because of their training or lack thereof.";positive
Finally, you need to provide statistics that accidental shootings of family, friends, and innocent persons occur more that self-defense shootings.;neutral
Otherwise, your statement is biased mis-information.;negative
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9715182;neutral
And there are independent studies all over that say about the same.;negative
The only stats that are different are the ones the NRA puts out... for obvious reasons.;negative
As for the gun shows, it depends more on the show and the seller than the state, and many states, like Arizona either don't have or don't enforce a wait.;negative
Cite your source because I am calling BULLSHIT.;negative
"you pulled those ""facts"" straight out of your ass.";neutral
Criminality and guns are not even linked.;negative
Switzerland requires every home to be armed (military grade weapons at that) and they have a very enviably low level of violence.;negative
Relax dirty hairy.;neutral

And there are independent studies all over that say about the same.;negative

I love how you NRA nuts pick and choose info.;neutral
Probably not your fault, you read what's given to you.;neutral
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Switzerland;neutral
They have guns, but not ammo so...;neutral
When they did have ammo it was tightly regulated, counted in fact regularly to ensure nothing was missing.;negative
I'd have no problem with the Swiss method of gun control in fact.;negative
Banning firearms will only create an imbalance between those who have firearms and those who do not.;negative
This imbalance could exist between a government wishing to oppress or between a potential criminal and a potential victim.;negative
The only way to ban firearms and prevent an imbalance with firearms is to eliminate the firearms.;negative
Banning them will not solve a problem.;negative
Banning firearms will only create a more severe imbalance.;negative
yeah totaly they say take all the guns away give to the government how are we to trust a government with that much money guns power and influence pluss the fact they the government in america would never take away the freedom of speach before the the right to bare arms because the second ammendment is the fail safe for the first ammendment.;neutral
1.;neutral
Hunting.;neutral
2.;neutral
The people should be empowered, and able to fight against tyranny and assaults.;negative
3.;neutral
The black market would provide plenty of guns.;neutral
We don't need them to outlaw guns entirely, but I believe they should be heavily regulated.;negative
Like... think of all the insane people in the NRA... some of which who damn near literally sleep with their guns.;negative
I don't think people that obsessed with guns should frankly have guns.;neutral
Guns are not toys.;negative
They are weapons.;neutral
So while they shouldn't be outlawed, everyone should need a very large sum of licenses to own them, and the prerequisites to get these licenses should discourage a recreational interest in guns and promote a defensive interest in guns.;negative
Perhaps even make it legally required that you only recreationally use a gun when for the purpose of practicing how to use it, not for the fun of it.;negative
But outright outlaw them?;neutral
Well... guns can protect as well as assault, so they don't have a purely evil purpose.;negative
Therefore, outlawing them from the public is silly if they can benefit people and not just kill innocent people.;negative
So no, they should not be outlawed, but MUCH MORE REGULATED then they are now.;negative
Guns should not be banned because it is a constitutional right to bare arms.;negative
This right was written into the constitution because it is the final defense against a tyrannical or oppressive ruling body.;negative
Hopefully, it never comes to that again, but that situation cannot be guaranteed from occurring.;negative
Any Federal gun regulation I am against.;negative
It makes little sense to give the Federal government the ability to regulate gun ownership to an individual level.;negative
I believe that it's okay for the States to require gun registrations.;neutral
I don't exactly believe that it's a must, but to me it's truly up to the States and local governments to decide for themselves.;negative
I would not demand that the Federal government goes the other way and restrict the ability for States to register gun ownership.;negative
However, I find any gun bans to be Unconstitutional and ineffective.;neutral
Gun control is a tactic in the gaining of greater power on the part of the government, and one which, like drug control, appears on the surface (having been so layered with propaganda) to be beneficial to society (i.e. to the weak-minded).;negative
However, outcomes of the criminalization of firearm possession show otherwise.;neutral
Crime rates went up in Britain following the illegalization of handguns (source) whereas, in Chicago, which had previously a ban on handguns, crime rates went down upon the overturning of their ban (the mayor went so far as to say that, without this ban, there's be duels in the streets - I would not ever vote for so weak-minded a fella!);negative
(source).;neutral
The University of Colorado instituted a handgun ban and saw a rise in crime of 35%, whilst Colorado State University allowed students to carry a concealed firearm, and crime rates went down 60% (source).;negative
"As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""no freeman shall be debarred the use of arms.""";negative
(source);neutral
No because guns dont kill people, people kill people......................................;neutral
No, firearms are generally used for far more things than murder/killing.;neutral
(Gun competitions, and using guns for sport are just two of many reasons.);negative
The second amendment of the constution protects the right to bare arms (generally meant for protection), as well.;negative
What people don't seem to grasp is that outlawing something will not necessarily mean it will disappear.;negative
No matter how hard you crack down, there will still be plenty of people wo have guns.;negative
The Prohibition and the War on Drugs have proven this.;neutral
All in all, less bloodshed when it's legal.;neutral
Sorry, double post due to Internet lag.;positive
Please disregard this second post.;neutral
Restricting a weapon to the public makes the problem of public safety worse.;negative
Sure, every law-abiding citizen is likely to comply, but every criminal will still pack heat because they didn't care about the law to start with.;negative
Yeah, let us put a ban on all guns in these United states so that way we have total and utter chaos.;negative
"It is not like our enemies (present and future) would say, ""oh, they don't have guns anymore, let's leave them alone.""";negative
By banning guns we are not only putting a big target on our personal life (robberies, e.t.c) but our entire nation.;neutral
Idiots.;neutral
"Also, for all of you people who believe that ""guns kill people"", take away a man's stick, he will find a stone.";negative
In other words, if you ban guns (good luck collecting all of them anyway) people will still kill other people with whatever they can find.;negative
It is sad but true.;neutral
And to everyone who says that tazers are a good substitute, they have on charge and probably wont even knock them out, assuming you hit them.;negative

There should be strict gun control laws.;neutral
I believe we should absolutely take away all the guns, but only if there is an accountable government that would not take advantage of us having no guns and expand their power and if there is no way any guns could enter the country at all.;negative
Until then I will cling to my guns.;positive
I'm going to go on this side just for the hell of it, but I honestly don't care.;negative
I don't want a gun, I won't use one, and I have my wits about me usually well enough to know when a situation might go sour, so I likely won't be involved in any shootings.;negative
Give everyone a tank for all I care.;negative
no...it wont be long (hopefully) before we are fighting the war machine our tax dollars paid for...dont pretend like our government gives a shit about our safty...they want gun control so they have more CONTROL.;negative

You sound like a hillbilly who dropped out in 3rd grade and think government puts chips in new born babies... what's your point?;negative
Which you have thanks to luck of the draw living in a place which allows this.;positive
The vast majority of humans ever born have no such rights.;negative
Cute bumper sticker.;negative
Irrelevant to my argument.;neutral
America has had drafts in many of its wars, you think that because we don't have one now we never will?;negative
Seriously, we had four drafts in the past century.;negative
My point is you sound irrational.;negative
Now I know that in your mind even hinting at the fact the government can do bad things makes someone hillbilly, but please, try to expand your mind a little.;negative
We are talking about the united states laws, not a global law.;negative
Other humans not having rights does not mean that mean that individual rights are not empowering.;negative
Cute way of ignoring the point.;negative
1) There hasn't been a draft in place for over 40 years, ever since the Vietnam War ended.;negative
2) This is a democratic republic, which is different from both a true republic and a true democracy.;positive
"A true democracy is where every citizen would get the right to vote on each issue put before a governing body; for example, ancient Athens in Greece.";negative
"A true republic is where a portion, but not all, of the population elects a group of people to vote on issues for them; for example, the ancient Roman Republic.";negative

Why is there an ignorant lack of knowledge about Somalia's history?;negative
Somalia (or Somali land as it was back then) was a colony up until after WWII.;negative
Somalia was ruler my a oppressive and tyrannical government up until the 1990's.;negative
Although Somalia's economy began to get better after the collapse of the corrupt and monopolistic government, many warlords tried to seize power.;negative
Somalia was a shit hole longer before its government collapsed.;negative
You're changing the subject.;neutral
"It may well have been a shit hole, but that shit hole has been and is full of people who have the same ""individual rights"" as you do, and yet without a government, or with a dictatorship, that mattered jack squat.";negative
That just further proves my point: you need a government, and a good government, to make sure you hold onto your rights.;positive
That's ridiculous.;negative
You realize the military is voluntary;neutral
that this is a democracy;neutral
Money's influence over government, which the majority has allowed, is responsible for the ills of the state, not the government itself.;negative
Government is your and my only source of any power whatsoever.;negative
Take that away and all you have is ill.;neutral
Ever hear of the draft?;neutral
No its a republic, stop treating it like a democracy.;negative
"Christ, you sound like one of those ""utilize the power of the ballot"" college students with the Che Guevara shirt.";neutral
My source of power is my individual rights, I have (or at least should have) the power to make decisions in my own life.;negative

"Before posting I want you to consider that all the places where all the recent shootings took place where so called ""gun free zones"" this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that these zones are not only ineffective but dangerous because they are a place where a blood thirsty psyco can be shure he can make the most of the 30 minutes he/she/they have before the police arrive.";negative
The best way to minimize the risk of massicar is to allow the citizenry the tools nessisary to stop one as soon as it starts there are instances of school shootings and theater shootings being stopped and even prevented by armed bystanders for example check out the links I posted in the debate section.;negative
The other point I want to make is laws only stop the law abiding.;negative
someone intent on committing murder the most serious crime in our countrie is not going to be stopped because a lesser crime with a lesser punishment stands in his way.;negative
never has a street racer been thwarted by a speed limit, never has a drive by been prevented because its illegal to keep loded gun in your car.;negative
"And never has a school shooting mall shooting or theater shooting ever been foile by a ""gun free zone";negative
I don't think gun free zones cause shootings, but I sure don't think they help.;negative
"It's not like a would-be mass murderer is going to say, ""Oh shit, they don't allow guns here.";negative
"I'm going to have to pick a different place.""";neutral
"My point exactly and to add on to that I believe in some cases such as the aurora Colorado shooting and the recent mall shootings the fact that the buildings were ""gun free zones"" may have influenced the shooters decision.";negative
"And Adam Lanza picked sandy hook and no one knew his motive for choosing an elementary school my theory is that it was the nearest ""gun free zone"" or for shock value/infamy maybe both.";negative
OK, now this is something I don't like about CreateDebate.;negative
"Since my side is ""Yes"" and you clicked ""Dispute,"" it set your side to ""No,"" when that's obviously not what you want.";negative
Now the vote is 2-1 when it should be 3-0.;neutral
It's okay I fixed it.;positive
You can switch the side you want your argument to contribut points to by clicking edit or while typing it.;neutral
"Just click the small blue ""switch"" button located above the text box bellow the orange side title at the top of the page in this case the orange ""yes"" or ""no""";negative
Is there evidence that shooters target gun free zones?;neutral
I would think that Adam Lanza just wanted to shoot up his old elementary school.;negative
Even if it weren't labeled gun free, that's no reason to expect that someone would be armed.;negative
And he was planning to die anyway, so it wouldn't matter all that much if someone were armed.;negative
Well it would matter if he wanted to kill a lot of people.;neutral
"These shooters want to die in a way they deem ""glorious"" and being shot by someone who was supposed to be one of their victims before they've gotten three rounds off is probably not what most of them have in mind.";negative
And no there's no evidence it's just my theory he wanted to attack our children ware we think they are safe.;negative
It would add to his infamy.;neutral
Getting shot by an intended victim before getting three rounds off would be a worst case scenario for the shooter.;negative
Best case scenario (for the shooter), the hero misses and kills some bystanders, then the shooter kills the hero and takes his gun.;negative
On average, the hero takes a while to find the shooter and figure out how to subdue them without hurting anyone else, and the shooter makes maybe half as many kills as they otherwise would have.;negative
I don't know, I'm just guessing here.;negative
And this is only if someone is armed, which might not be the case.;negative
I don't know if the possibility of another gun out there is going to be much of a deterrent.;negative
The best case scenario (for the shooter) is he gets to massacre freely for 30minutes then kill himself when the cops arrive.;negative
he/she is there to kill as Manet people as they can because its fun to them they don't want anyone els stealing there fun.;negative
The best case scenario (for the shooter) is he gets to massacre freely for 30minutes then kill himself when the cops arrive.;negative
he/she is there to kill as Manet people as they can because its fun to them they don't want anyone els stealing their fun.;negative
Or they are there for revenge and don't want anyone stealing their revenge.;neutral
they should and since most shootings are taking places at scholl they should have a securtiy gaurd armed with a small firearm there onyly job would to patrole the premisis and make sure that there is no one there should be there;neutral
The fact that the good guy is a good guy prevents them from doing bad.;negative
If a good guy were to do bad, they wouldn't be a good guy anymore, now would they?;negative
But why are you so focused on just gun killings?;negative
Shouldn't it be the Total kills that you're worried about?;negative
"Having more guns may not decrease the percentage of ""gun deaths"" but is sure as hell reduces overall crime rates and overall murder rates.";negative
That is extremely stupid, I'm sorry but it is.;negative
Clearly, in your mind, criminals follow the law and by making it harder to get guns will force these criminals to follow these anti-gun laws just like the kind law-abiding citizens they are.;negative
Dude, seriously?;neutral
Criminals will get guns no matter what.;negative
They have black markets etc.;neutral
They aren't going to follow any damn gun laws.;negative
We need guns as citizens to protect ourselves from these criminals.;negative

If anything, these stories say that the gun free zones need to be more strict.;neutral
I'm against that, but that is becoming the case.;neutral
I say we need the gun free zones just like we need the rules in place against kids doing illegal substances that are legal for adults.;negative
The stories only talk about bad guys being stopped because good guys had guns.;negative
Who stops the bad guys if you take away the guns from the good guys?;neutral
Who's saying take the guns from the bad guys?;neutral
We're saying don't let the good guys or the bad guys with guns into some areas of the world.;negative
Leave their guns on the porch, and come in for a relaxing glass of tea before going back into the harsh world where everyone wants to shoot you.;negative
You are saying in this area it is illegal to carry a gun.;neutral
So, good guys can't have their guns.;positive
But, you don't do anything to take away the guns from the bad guys.;negative
So, bad guys can come in with guns and regular people can't stop them.;negative
This thought is just insane.;negative
Newtown was a gun free zone by your definition of gun free zone.;negative
In gun free zones, yes.;neutral
Are we in a comic book?;neutral
Can we refer to them in the proper terms, the good guys, are the police.;positive
The bad guys, are the criminals.;neutral
Why on Earth would we take the guns from the police?;negative
We would prevent the criminals from getting guns but when they do inevitable, the police would stop them.;negative
There would be way less gun violence if only the police and the criminals had them, and every time a criminal showed his, was stopped.;negative
Civilians can't stop gunmen in the 1st place, criminal or otherwise.;negative
Were their police with guns in newtown?;neutral
I am sorry that you are confused.;negative
We are only talking about non law enforcement, the civilians.;negative
Your whole argument makes no sense after that.;negative
Normal civilians with guns stop criminal civilians.;negative
Please address my previous argument with this in mind.;neutral
"""You are saying in this area it is illegal to carry a gun.";positive
So, normal civilians can't have their guns.;negative
But, you don't do anything to take away the guns from the criminal civilians.;negative
"So, criminal civilians can come in with guns and regular people can't stop them.""";negative
Apparently you didn't read the stories.;negative
In America it is possible.;positive
They do not need guns.;negative
Normal civilians with guns are known as vigilantes.;negative
They are illegal.;neutral
There is no reason to readdress your argument because I don't believe normal citizens should be shooting anyone.;negative
They never know what the situation is that made a person fire a gun.;negative
If normal citizens are firing guns at criminal citizens then when the police come in all they see is citizens firing guns.;negative
If a normal citizen with a gun comes into a room where a 'criminal' has a gun in his hand and their are dead students on the floor, the normal citizen with the gun will shoot the 'criminal', then an investigation reveals that all the dead children had guns.;negative
It's much better to leave this up to the police.;negative
Well, that's not fair, you are too dumb to argue with.;negative
The stories presented describe exactly what you are against and it worked.;positive
I see anti gun people seem to have their feelings that deep down they are helping because it feels right.;negative
The pro gun people provide evidence that guns help.;neutral
They do if the police are NOWHERE NEARBY.;neutral
Really?;neutral
Since when was this the case?;neutral
Civilians are the sovereign power in America, not the government.;negative
"And perhaps you have not heard about ""private security"" companies?";neutral
Basically civilians with guns and uniforms, tasked with enforcing law and order on private property.;negative
Furthermore, the police force is nothing more than a private security firm hired by the government anyway.;negative
"If anything is illegal, it's granting these ""public security firms"" special privileges normal civilians are not allowed.";negative
That's already the case, and yet criminals still gain access to these areas, WHILE in possession of guns, and STILL shoot people up in these areas.;positive
How does making having guns in these places illegal stop criminals, who by definition don't follow laws, from bringing guns in ANYWAY?;neutral
"I guess this makes the average citizen ""collateral damage.""";negative
Sorry, I don't want to be collateral damage, I want to be able to defend myself from criminals who are in front of me NOW, while the Police are still MINUTES AWAY.;negative
Well, when you deny them their natural right of self defense, yes, that's true.;positive
However, any and all civilians who carry guns and exercise their right to self-defense, CAN stop Gunmen.;neutral
Whether they were legally carrying or not.;neutral
Not at the place the shooter shot up.;neutral
Obviously.;neutral
That's why there should have been some CIVILIANS with Guns there, because the police, even though THEY were allowed to carry, were entirely absent.;negative
Whether a policeman can carry a gun or not is irrelevant if the police aren't there exactly at the when a gun is needed.;negative
Please tell me your being sarcastic.;negative
First of all gun free means just that no guns period how can that be any stricter?;neutral
Second all the stories told of instances when gun toting bystanders saved people thus proving that disarming citizens is a bad thing.;negative
And third when have those laws prohibiting kids from substances completely legal for adults ever worked?;neutral
Did you even go to high school?;neutral
I'm not, sorry.;negative
You mean to tell me guns free means no police either?;neutral
You know who else was a gun toting bystander?;neutral
The original shooter.;neutral
If they did searches of people that would have prevented the criminalistic gun toting citizens from shooting people, but as I said I don't want that.;negative
They lower the frequency.;negative
You must admit that.;neutral
I'm usually in your favor with the gun control rules, but now you want to take the peace of mind from the people who want a gun free area.;positive
C'mon!;neutral
Will you ever be satisfied?;neutral
What next, a mandatory gun in every home!?!?;negative
If one was to make the fun free zone stricter, that would be the only option, to disarm police officers as well.;negative
Why do you support police officers being armed but not civilians?;negative
Certainly armed civilians can exist in places the police will not always frequent.;neutral
Thus providing equal force to counter a killer as a police officer would.;negative
By definition the shooter could not have been a bystander.;negative
-.;neutral
-;neutral
So we've screened the murderer, he's not carrying a gun.;negative
He enters the gun-free zone, and then pulls out a sword...;positive
Or he gains access to the zone by some back-entrance not screened and pulls out his gun...;neutral
Or he shoots into the gun-free zone from outside of it...;neutral
Or he lives and works in this gun-free zone for many years, and, using the tools and materials available in the zone, builds himself a gun... or sword...;neutral
Or, just to be a prick, he bombs the entrance to the zone, killing the screening guards, and then pulls out his gun and enters the zone...;neutral
How do you solve these issues?;neutral
Actually that would be one of few mandates I would actually support, somewhat.;negative
Abolish all legally created Gun Free Zones (private entities should be free to make their own rules, but highly encouraged to not forbid weapons),;negative
And THEN, establish mandatory gun responsibility and training courses in school, at a young age.;negative
Educate children that guns are not toys and are NOT to be treated lightly, and are most certainly not to be used for selfish reasons like killing someone you dislike or who treats you bad.;negative
Then provide safe competitions and contests for students to settle their beef with each other, rather than resorting to killing and bullying.;negative
I would find that gun free zones are nothing more then wishful thinking.;negative
"Concerts for example are ""gun free zones"".";neutral
Yet, in the case of dime bag Darrel (lead guitarist of Damage Plan) was gunned down on stage in front of many fans.;negative
If everyone had been armed with guns and knives he may have thought twice about taking a hostage and the three others that died along with the guitarist would probably have survived.;negative
Nathan Gale was also shot dead by the police.;negative
http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494653/guitarist-dimebag-darrell-slain-club-shooting.jhtml;neutral
They don't really help at all.;neutral
Actually, they help the gunman because that eliminates the risk of the psychopath getting shot by another citizen with a concealed weapon.;negative
"I read an article about a women and her parents shopping in a ""Gun Free Zone,"" so like a law-abiding citizen, she left her gun in the car.";negative
As she was shopping with her parents, a gunman walked in and killed both of them, but the women lived.;negative
She had to live with the fact that she could have saved her parents, if she had her gun with her.;positive
To stop the killing with guns you you have to make it harder to get guns.;negative
I don't think more guns is going to make things more safer.;negative
Who is going to stop the good guy from going bad?;negative
Having Armed Police Officers present reduces the amount of crime that occurs in that present location.;negative
Why?;negative
It's not because they're police officers.;negative
It's because it is an Armed Deterrent.;negative
Police Officers can not exist in all places at once.;negative
So this necessarily means that the Armed Deterrent is lacking in certain specific areas.;negative
Put guns in everyone's hands, and then you have successfully placed an Armed Deterrent anywhere and everywhere a civilian is present.;positive
What stops these Armed Civilian good guys from going bad?;neutral
All the other Armed Civilians surrounding them who can shoot them the moment they turn bad.;negative
I'm going to speak exclusively on schools.;neutral
No one is making the argument that saying that a school is a gun free zone will stop 100% of mass shootings.;negative
If someone wants to go shoot up a school, there isn't much you can do to stop that.;negative
People with access to guns are capable of killing people, after all, whatever laws are in place.;negative
But, the law isn't trying to make schools 100% safe.;negative
They are trying to make schools safer.;neutral
If everyone had a gun, we still wouldn't stop mass shootings.;negative
People would still be able to kill a number of people, if they attacked a school with assault rifles and grenades.;negative
But there would also be a huge number of accidental deaths, and of shootings done in anger, in the moment.;negative
People have shot their loved wifes and husbands, their boyfriends and girlfriends of many years, the people they love most in their lives.;positive
Put them in a fight at school (like what happens hundreds of times all over the world) and give them a gun, and there'll be hundreds of deaths every day at schools.;negative
Yes, if you say that the aim of making a school a gun free zone is to stop 100% of shootings, then you can say that it has failed in this respect.;negative
But any reasonable assessment of their effectiveness will clearly show that they have saved an uncountable number of lives.;negative
"Let me start my counter argument with a quote regarding the second part of your argument ""those who sacrifice liberty in the name of safety shall deserve neither and lose both""-Benjamin Franklin.";negative
We see through out history whenever gun control laws are put in place violent crime and murder in particular go up.;negative
The vast majority of our nations homicide rate aside from vehicular man slaughter and medical malpractice is justifiable homicide by civilians and police (self defense) and the majority of our nations actual murder rate come from Chicago, Detroit, Los Angels, and New York the 4 cities with the most restrictive gun control laws.;negative
Unless you can actually quantify the number of lives that have been saved through gun control, yours is a non-argument and fundamentally flawed from the get-go.;negative
Unlike yours however, one CAN quantify the number of lives that have been saved by looser control.;negative
It stands to reason that, if one is presented with a mass shooter, and that mass shooter is shot and killed, or held at bay, before he can unload his magazine entirely, by someone who was present and carrying a firearm as well.;negative
The person has undoubtably prevented as many injuries/deaths, as the shooter had ammunition left.;negative
Furthermore, it stands to reason that the Earlier a person shoots and kills such a menance, the more lives are saved by it, and likewise the Later such a shooting can be done, the more lives are lost, or injuries caused.;negative
The point is not to prevent a mass shooting, such thing would be entirely impossible, the point is to MINIMIZE the amount of damage that such a mass shooting can cause.;negative
If every mass murder was killed after firing just one shot, you can quantify the number of lives saved and injuries prevented.;negative
However, if all you're relying on is the honor system to prevent mass shootings, and forbid people the option of proactively removing the threat as soon as possible, Each and Every Single One of them is going to have MASS Victims.;negative
So, which then is in actuality the real safest solution?;negative
"Prevent an unknown number of ""potential"" mass murders, and permit the real ones that get through to cause extreme loss of life and injury?";positive
"Or stop each and every one of them that actually occurs as soon as possible, as well as stop a similarly unquantifiable number (as the ""gun prohibition"" choice) of ""potential"" threats on top of that?";neutral
As for kids shooting each other in fights.;negative
This is reduced through education, teaching the kinds responsibility and to not treat guns lightly or use them in personal feuds.;negative
It can be further reduced by providing alternative means for settling disputes that equally burn out the anger, such as competitions and contests, and frequently encouraging their frequent use.;negative
It can be even further reduced through strict penalties for misuse, abuse, and criminal use of the weapons, as well as confiscation on a case by case basis, rather than unilaterally and universally.;negative
If easily available weapons are problem, then having more of them is not obviously a solution.;negative
It's just a proof how well you have been brainwashed by weapons manufacturer's lobby.;neutral
Easily available weapons aren't the problem.;negative
Restrictive gun laws disarming the victims and leavening them vulnerable is the problem.;negative
Your argument is proof of how well you have been brain washed by the Anti-gun lobby.;negative
In the majority of school shootings it's the legally bought easily available Guns that have been used not the illegal ones bought off the street.;negative
"""Those who sacrifice liberty for safety deserve neither and lose both""-Benjamin Franklin.";negative
The means by which these psychos get guns is irrelevant and trying to restrict access to guns will punish the rest of us as well and leave us more vulnerable to criminals who do purchase their weapons illegally.;negative
I'm suggesting that a good way to lessen the risk and effect of these shootings while not increasing the national murder rate as happened in Detroit, Chicago, LA, New York and DC when their hand gun ban was active is to allow citizens to be armed in the facility's most likely to be subject to attack.;negative
"According to your ""logic"".";positive
Government should give away cocaine to kids because what will sort out ease of access to drugs than more easily accessible drugs?;negative
"According to your ""logic"" no one does cocaine because it has been banned.";negative
obviously done much less than if unbanned....;negative
isn't it ?;negative
I always enjoy that you guys never quite have the perfect solution.;positive
Much less cocaine is used.;neutral
Gun deaths are almost 0, but at least the numbers are lower.;negative
Never quite get rid of drug use, never quite get rid of gun death.;negative
but you still can reduce it to the level similar to civilized countries .;neutral
I don't think you can.;neutral
You actually don't have a good reason to believe that the gun control regulations are the cause.;negative
If we skip place like Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan then USA is the only country on the world that allows mentally ill people to have unlimited amount of army grade weapons and ammo... so yes, you have problem with easily accessible weapons.;negative
Good point.;positive
Well, except for the fact that those people tend to account for a very small portion of gun deaths.;negative
The real problem is in how we deal with easily accessible firearms.;negative
Over here in America we don't want to address the issue of the mentally ill.;negative
It is just a gut reaction, and let's ban everything, oh, and maybe address accessibility.;negative
No necessary everything, just things that aren't useful for real life self defense.;negative
Things like: large capacity mags, rifles, large caliber weapons, special ammo, silencers...;negative
I'm from Czech Republic if you want to have a weapon (actual handgun).;negative
It used to be that only those who were drafted a had clean record from army could have a weapon.;negative

You have to undergo 2 psychological screenings, be 25 years old, do several week training and the most important you have to prove that you need a gun.;negative
After that you will get a weapon licence.;neutral
You have to chose a handgun from list of allowed ones, no special ammo, silencers, etc. allowed.;negative
You can have only one additional clip with you.;neutral

We have ten times less gun kills per 100 000 than US and even from those is 80% suicides.;negative
In the UK it's even 4x less.;negative
I don't understand the need to tell someone how they should defend themselves.;negative
2 psychological screenings ... 80% suicides;neutral
So, what is wrong with the psychological screenings over there that you can't weed out the ones who will commit suicide.;negative
When we get psych screenings over here I want them to be better than yours.;negative
I am sorry, but with the length of time that gun regulation has been in place in England, any number of gun deaths over 0 is too high.;negative
Although, if it was kept to single digits I would still consider that success.;negative
those 80% are 4 people from 11 000 000.;neutral
I don't think so that you will do any better.;negative
...you have no gun law at all.;negative
and 35000 kill shots every year .;neutral
.;neutral
and you are disappointed with UK's score?;neutral
:D lol;neutral
So, 80% of gun deaths happen because a twice screened person killed themselves, which implies that the screening failed.;negative
And, you don't think we can do better than that?;negative
So, what is the point of the screenings if they don't/can't work?;negative
Yeah, why would I want to do something that doesn't work?;negative
we have 92% less death by gun that US.;neutral
So it works, they aren't screened for suicides, that isn't a crime or threat moron.;negative
"You have gun like Somalia... so stop shitting ""what you would do better"" when you do nothing.";negative
My favorite diversion tactic.;positive
I believe that eliminating death by gun is not really the overall goal.;negative
If the overall murder rate would be higher without guns, then the trade off of higher gun deaths is ok.;negative
"Oh, ok, so all we need to do is ask the question ""Hey, are you suicidal?""";negative
Sweet, that helps.;neutral
It seems like a dumb idea to leave that question off the screening if you actually cared about people dieing.;negative
"Why are those who support gun control so obsessed with reducing the number of ""GUN DEATHS"" as opposed to the ""OVERALL MURDER RATE""?";negative
The reason the US has more gun deaths than the UK?;negative
We have more people than you guys do, plan and simple.;negative
It's got nothing to do with gun restrictions or lack there-of.;negative
Now, please explain to me why most American gun crime occurs in areas of America where we have the strictest gun control laws in effect, and the areas in America with the lowest OVERALL CRIME rate have the Least Restrictive gun regulations.;negative
I'm still trying to spin my head around how gun control works in light of those facts.;negative
Yes, it is.;positive
You are correct.;neutral
The law to prevent gun violence in gun free areas, slows gun violence.;negative
Just as the law to prevent cocaine use, slows cocaine use.;negative
Who said any thing about handing anything out?;neutral
I'm just saying people should be allowed to have guns available to them whenever and wherever they deem it nessisary.;negative
And this doesn't apply to anyone under the legal age for ownership and carry either open or concealed of course.;negative
Maturity must still be taken into account.;neutral
There is no selection procedure who actually can own gun, neither training is mandatory.;negative
Also .22 with 6 round mag is enough for self deference.;negative
It's light, accurate and does not penetrate walls... but that would make your true government/weapons lobby unhappy :D;negative
There is a selection procedure it's called a background check what els do you want.;negative
And your right a 22.;positive
Revolver is a fantastic weapon in my opinion but some people want bigger guns a d the founders made it pretty clear that the right to bare arms shall not be infringed so tell your queen Dian Finstine to read the constitution.;neutral
So you are allowed to ride a tank or own a nuke warheads ?;negative
Firearms not war heads obviously pleas try to avoid creating straw men and keep your arguments within the realm of reality.;negative
And you can own a tank they are massively expensive but its legal.;negative
what about chemical and biological rounds for your mortar or tanks ...does it still counts as a second amendment?;negative
What is with you and the straw man arguments today?;neutral
And no those have been outlawed by the Geneva convention so if we ever did have to fight our own government (the reason the second amendment was wrighten) we wouldn't be able to use those wouldn't need to either those are just shootable bad ideas.;negative
Was the signing under Geneva convention pact a big problem in US?;negative
...it limits your rights given you by second amendment.;negative
.;neutral
Not entirely war needs rules it had them back in 1777 and it should have them now.;negative
The fact is the second amendment gives us the ability to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government.;positive
And some weapons shouldn't even be used in war.;negative
I think that it does more harm than good.;negative
In 1770 the high tech was guy on horse wit percussive rifle so it had some sense but now when potentially tyrannical government (I assume that suppose to be US gov) has things like tanks, jet, ships, submarines, missiles, nukes, bombers ...so allowing people to have rifles has no point anymore.;negative
The hypothetical conflict would be something like present USA army vs. preset NK...;neutral
I disagree guerrilla warfare is highly effective it's the simple matter of brains over brawn you see.;positive
And the real war as every dictator knows is for the hearts and minds of the people if we convince enough people to rise up the government will be forced to back down both by internal struggle and international pressure.;positive
But we must be allowed the tools nessisary for the less glorious side of war as well.;negative
Look at Syria, that is rifle vs. rifle.;negative
Guerrilla never worked anywhere, it's useless.;negative
Lets see it worked in Vietnam, it worked in Afghanistan (ask Russia) it worked in France (French resistance) it worked in Russia (Russian partisans) and oh yeah it worked in America;negative
you are skipping a little detail that those guerrillas were fully supported and trained by another country.;negative
"Also they were not attacked by ""tyrannical"" government otherwise they would be bombed out in few days.";negative
Same as Saddam bombed out Kurdish.;negative
It's just a propaganda from weapons manufacturers hoping that you buy more useless weapons.;negative
Guerrilla war has to be allowed by the attackers, they have to respect human rights and respect civilians otherwise they just wipe you out.;negative
The Russians invaded Afghanistan, we invaded Vietnam, the nazis invade France, the nazis invade Russia, the British declared martial law in the colonies.;negative
In all those instances it was the defender who used guerrilla warfare.;negative
When martial law goes down those who chose to fight against it will escape to secluded areas and form insurgent groups where I live there's a shit ton of mountains prime real estate.;negative
A d many of the people most adamant about defending gun rights are veterans, active duty solders, law enforcement officers, and even if you aren't one of these modern gun fighting lessons are easily found http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fwHbIvju2c8;negative
"http://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=related&v;=4eSrccO4DKI";neutral
Hiding in mountains had sense before inventing infrared targeting :D I also quite doubt yours AK47/ar15 efficiency in shooting down drone or F22... :D;negative
That's why I picked the mountains drones can't see you if your in a cave.;negative
And a Barrett 50.;positive
Cal sniper rifle (legal in most states) will make quick work of drones.;negative
Besides I have no doubt a fair bit of the military will be on our side.;negative
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C8N91O04EhE;neutral
Hitting drone with rifle :D :D yeah... :D what about using slingshot wit hand grenades?;negative
:D :D.;neutral
You will be presented as terrorist to rest of the population, nobody would be at your side.;negative
Just few hundreds of rednecks.;neutral
.;neutral
no big deal.;negative
The 50.;neutral
Cal is a tank killer as in it was designed to destroy fucking tanks what would it will do to a drone?;negative
Well a lot actually.;positive
You'll be presented as terrorists to the rest of the population nobody would be at your side;negative
That's exactly what the British thought and tried to portray the colonists as it didn't work.;negative
Mubarak's government called the protesters terrorists that didn't work we've been calling AlQuida terrorists for years now and they continue to draw recruites.;negative
The problem is one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter.;negative
"But what dose this have to do with abolishing ""gun free zones""";neutral
Effective range of .50 is one mile in distance ....;positive
"that is max 300 meters the ""up way"" :D ...drone cal fly much higher.";negative
.;neutral
You are ignoring the part about solders defecting, bringing things with them, we may have rocket launchers brought to us by solders who decide to side with us.;negative
"But anyway are you basceing you entire argument on ""it's useless don't bother"" really?";negative
I'm shure there where a fare bit of colonists who shared that sentiment back during the revolution look I never said it would be easy but if we don't try what kind of men would we be?;negative
what about sending crows of ducks into jets engines ?;neutral
That might not be such a bad idea.;negative
A little unorthodox but it could work.;negative
Of just shot its engines with a Barrett 50.;neutral
cal.;neutral
But like I also said many solders are constitutionalists (peace officers too look up oath keepers) we will have some shit we don't have now.;negative
The links are to videos demonstrating my pointy on classes I tried to link the first one directly but the site is being bitchy with me.;negative
Here are some more videos;neutral

Wow... that is a very stupid connection.;negative
Cocaine is far different.;neutral
Cocaine should be restricted, because you don't need to protect yourself with cocaine.;negative
Guns, on the other hand, will be obtained by criminals no matter the laws, because of the simple fact that they are criminals.;negative
They don't follow the laws.;neutral
Gun laws will only restrict the victims of criminals from protecting themselves.;negative
People die now because they can't protect themselves.;neutral
Chicago has the most restrictive gun laws in America, and they also have the most killings by guns in the United States.;negative
Is that not proof enough for you?;neutral
I dont think aboloshing Gun Free Zones is the answer especially in places like schools as someone else has pointed out Guns in a volatile place like schools is not a good idea and if Guns are allowed it would be hard for someone to differentiate between a Shooter and someone just carrying their Gun for self defence but maybe having armed guards on the premises might work as a deterrent whilst safeguarding peole.;negative
But why hire more personnel when you can just arm teachers?;negative
In schools the kids won't be armed obviously you need to be 21 to carry a gun about anyway.;neutral
But if we arm and train teachers that would be a financially sound way of improving student safety.;neutral
I think that would be cheaper to build a huge wall around the school... :D;negative
Not really the building cost of putting a huge wall around every school in America would be enormous.;negative
school with 30 teachers;neutral
"...all of them with private ""Security & close protection"" training which costs about $5000/per person, plus weapons, weekly shootings, compensations for teachers, repeating training every 2 years...";negative
You can build a proper wall :D;positive
Ah but if the school simply makes training and practice hours mandatory for those who wish to be armed then they can go and find the best concealed carry class and range for them.;negative
And of course the cost of ammo will be low too as teacher will only be provided 2 extra mags (they should be allowed to bring more form home if they wanted to though);negative
alternatively I'm sure your local police or sheriffs department will have no problem training the teachers and letting them use their range they will have to coordinate range days of course but that's not a problem where I live the El Paso county sheriffs office and Colorado Springs police department share a range and it works out for the two of them.;negative
So teacher will be the first one dies... that does not makes a big difference to me...;negative
Gun free zones are a reality that life needs.;negative
"We need more ""free zones""";neutral
People are bound get offended by some things and when they do they want to go somewhere where they are not.;negative
On the internet that is much easier to do, one must simply log off, but in the real world it's harder to do.;negative
If they were completely gone, it'd be impossible to do.;negative
People who want to use their guns can use their guns in the non gun free zones, while the people who don't want to see them, can go the gun free areas.;negative
I see it as not limiting rights, but making this a better place for everyone.;negative
You don't have a way to prevent guns from getting in the gun free zones.;negative
Actual gun free zones are actually nice, they are called airports.;negative
"A ""sealed"" environment where everyone is checked before they enter.";negative
No duh.;neutral
Guns will find a way into gun free zones, just like drugs and alcohol will find a way into the hands of people who aren't allowed to have them.;negative
That doesn't mean we should just lift the law on it.;negative
Ok, now I don't know what you want.;negative
What do YOU mean by a gun free zone?;neutral
A place where you have the security of knowing they are illegal.;neutral
But that security is worthless because guns can easily get in.;negative
What is the point if the zone won't actually be gun free?;neutral
The security is for peace of mind.;positive
People can break into your house with locks on the door, yet you still lock those right?;positive
In locking the door you feel safer that people will not come in regardless of the fact that they can.;negative
No system is perfect, yet peace of mind should exist to defeat all of that.;positive
I guess I just don't know what about guns scares you.;negative
Are you afraid of being shot?;neutral
Hey, that's illegal.;neutral
Are you afraid of being robbed at gunpoint?;neutral
Hey, that's illegal.;neutral
Are you afraid of being kidnapped by a gunman?;neutral
Hey, that's illegal.;neutral
Peace of mind is up to you.;positive
It's not that guns scare me.;negative
It's that guns can be scary.;neutral
And people want to be in a place where they can be unafraid.;negative
Why should we deprive them of that?;negative
Peace of mind is up to the person who wants peace, and for that reason we have the government in place to protect that peace when they can't do it themselves.;positive
It's like this.;neutral
If guns were legal in school, when any fight happens, and they do, a gun could just as easily have been pulled out and used rather than fists.;negative
Why wouldn't you want to decrease the likelihood of that?;negative
It's not about my personal peace that these laws are in place, they are in place because the government is there to protect us.;negative
The government makes a rule you cannot shoot people.;negative
If you do you are prosecuted.;neutral
The government makes a rule you can not do crack, if you do you are prosecuted.;negative
Why should the government not make a rule that some areas are off limits to guns, where if you bring one, you will be prosecuted?;negative
No ones trying to take your guns, why do gun lovers have to take the peace of mind from the people afraid of them?;negative
Your entire argument basically ignored mine.;neutral
Give me an example of a gun being used legally that other people are afraid of.;negative
Let me make it as simple as possible for you.;positive
Soldier and police use.;neutral
I addressed all of your argument with the bolded letters, the ending was just saying how you have your rights, and the people who don't want guns around them should have theirs too.;negative
That's why I used the word basically.;negative
Everything that bad people can do with guns is illegal in the same way having guns would be illegal in a gun free zone, but that is not enough.;negative
Somehow banning guns is the thing that will finally do it.;positive
WHAT?!?!;neutral
You want to have citizens not carry guns, and you consider the only ones you think should have guns as scary?;negative
That seems silly to me.;negative
This just shows your peace of mind argument is crap.;negative
All this shows me is that you feel gun lovers won't be able to handle the freedom of having their guns out in places not designated as gun free.;neutral
As I said before, no one is trying to take your guns.;negative
They just want you to leave your guns out of their gun free zones.;negative
It's the same with a home, if you don't want drugs in your home, you don't ban all drugs, you just don't let them in your home.;negative
You can take extreme measures to accomplish this, patting people down, xrays, or you can just leave it up to the goodness of people to not bring drugs into your home, or guns into your gun free areas.;negative
All the Sandy Hook shooting said to me was, maybe more extreme measure need to be taken to keep gun free zones, gun free.;negative
They, with guns, are probably more feared them anyone without a gun.;negative
As I said before, i'm not afraid of gun use, I can't personally identify with people who feel guns should not be carried, that's why I'm not for banning guns.;negative
I'm for letting people who don't want guns around them, have an area where they can exist without guns.;negative
I don't see how that's asking for too much.;negative
It's not that it's crap, it's that it's based on opinionl and pretty bias, but rules around people that are victimless are usually bias, and they have to start somewhere.;negative
So I repeat, you can have your guns, can the people who don't want guns have a place to not be around them?;negative
Apparently not.;negative
We give those to you and you get killed in them.;neutral
Then you blame us.;neutral
Then this debate is virtually over.;neutral
You just want all the rights, and all the freeroam to have your guns wherever.;negative
Gun lovers, by all means keep your guns illegally, let the people who don't want guns to die in their folly.;positive
The people who don't want guns blame the gun lovers, because, as I just said, the gun lovers keep their illegally.;negative
The gun lovers are not doing anything illegal.;negative
The gun lovers leave their guns at home when in gun free zones.;negative
The criminals do not.;neutral
I do not think the people should have guns in gun free zones.;negative
I am saying gun free zones don't work.;neutral
You have also argued that they don't work.;neutral
Apparently, I am right.;negative
Duplicate;neutral
If they hold onto their guns when guns are illegal they are.;neutral
That's perfectly fine.;positive
The lunatics, didn't though, and that's when the cops stop them.;negative
Gun zones are not an exact science, obviously, but they are a solution to regular gun lovers getting upset, and firing off a round in their enemy's face!;negative
That stuff doesn't happen you psycho.;negative
Oh really?!;positive
So people that are angry never fight?;negative
I think if more people could openly carry guns, that they would use them if a heated discussion ever took place.;negative
AND In schools, where everyone's frontal lobe is under developed, it's more likely to happen faster and more often because no one will be thinking about the later consequences, just the current anger.;negative
In fact, if no one would ever use a gun when they were angry just because it's there, gun violence would not exist.;negative
People getting stabbed in the heat of the moment would not exist, throwing chairs, and knocking over tables would not exist.;negative
Get real, it would too happen.;negative
I said it doesn't happen.;negative
How do you explain the lack of gun violence in these confrontations in America.;neutral
Uh, no one is talking about giving the guns to the students.;negative
But, I agree we don't need kids to be armed.;neutral
"I think arguments would not get heated then ;)";neutral
The lack of guns, in these confrontations.;negative
Yet if these people had guns, like gangs often do, the fights would not be regular fights they'd be gun battles.;negative
Well what do you know.;neutral
A school....wait for it... is a gun free zone!;negative
If kids could have guns though, when a fight breaks out you'd have to be insane to think they wouldn't use them.;negative
(s)Obviously this must be true, because gun violence never happens.;negative
(/s);neutral
This issue is not about giving guns to people who shouldn't have them.;negative
And, you think there is a lack of guns in America, see you are crazy.;negative
is where all those kids got shot.;positive
I am going to pull a Quocalimar and make an outrageous claim that has no basis in reason and you will have to admit that guns help:;neutral
If we start getting people to turn in their guns, some people will obviously resist.;positive
There will be a group of people who keep their guns secretly.;positive
The people who don't want guns around will get suspicious.;negative
That's when the random murders happen.;neutral
"""Oh, I think I see Bob with a gun, I have to run him over with my car for the safety of the public.""";negative
"An anti gun ""task force"" of angry citizens will form.";negative
Anyone with a gun, or probably has one (wearing a suspicious trench coat) will be beaten until they give up their guns.;negative
But, gun violence will be gone, so everyone wins.;neutral
You misquoted me.;neutral
How do you explain the lack of gun violence in these confrontations in America.;neutral
Was your question.;neutral
My answer was that these areas with no gun violence have no guns in them.;negative
You said I must be crazy, I think a person who thinks that when two people get into a fight that they won't use whatever they have to win, is crazy.;negative
And again you misquoted.;positive
I said a school is a gun free zone.;neutral
If schools openly allowed guns, then when any fight breaks out, a gun will be used.;negative
The rest is all an attempt to belittle me, great logic by the way, and I don't even see a reason to respond to that.;positive
Also for future reference, if you want to sound intelligent, don't misquote people, it's not helpful to your cause.;negative
I didn't mean to, after all it was a copy paste.;negative
I meant that in America it is possible for basically anyone to have a gun on them.;neutral
People don't shoot people because they know it is wrong to shoot people, and eliminating gun free zones will not change that.;negative
LET ME SHOUT SO YOU CAN FINALLY HEAR ME.;negative
WHY DON'T WE SEE THIS ANYWHERE?;negative
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT THE SHOOTINGS HAPPENED IN A GUN FREE ZONE?;negative
You have absolutely no reason to believe this.;neutral
It doesn't happen anywhere, why would it suddenly start happening.;negative
Eliminating gun free zones means arming TEACHERS, not the students.;negative
I don't think the teachers will be getting into fights.;neutral
Only part of it was meant to belittle you.;neutral
You have no reason to believe that what I said won't happen, if we assume that what you think will happen is possible.;negative
If YOU want to sound intelligent you need to stop using insane impossible situations that would clearly be happening if you were right that they were possible.;negative
Possible doesn't mean that everyone does, it means that everyone can.;negative
Make no mistake, if everyone did have a gun on them, gun violence would increase as any minor dispute, moved to a hot enough temperature could involve the use of their firearm.;negative
It's the reason when you fight in a public place, people get slammed onto floors, knocked over chairs, pushed into objects.;negative
People, in the heat of the moment, will often do whatever it takes to win the fight.;neutral
Obviously you're not reading me.;negative
In a fight, whatever can be done to win, will be done.;negative
That quote that you answered to, wrong.;negative
The shooting happened because one person didn't follow the rule, no one said gun free zones would eliminate gun violence.;negative
Yes, but if it's a place where anyone can bring a gun, then anyone that can get a license for it, will bring a gun their.;negative
The kids are more likely to use them.;neutral
You think a kid will sit back and be bullied if he can pull a trigger and end it?;neutral
I think not.;neutral
Same for you.;neutral
So gang violence involving guns are insane impossible situations?;negative
Gang violence does happen.;negative
It's very possible.;positive
Anyone that has a gun will more than likely use it if a dispute does break out.;negative
Since when did abolishing gun free zones lead to everyone having a gun.;neutral
Obviously this is not true because we don't see it anywhere.;negative
That is my point, gun free zones don't prevent gun violence, therefore there is no reason to have them.;negative
We have restrictions on the age someone can own a gun.;negative
Those restrictions will not be lifted, you argument is invalid.;negative
Cool, since it is evident that eliminating gun free zones has no negative side effects, you must admit that taking away guns will cause massive amounts of violence.;negative
Seeing as you believe my scenario is fully reasonable.;positive
You are saying that if we eliminate gun free zones, every man, woman, and child will have a gun on them.;neutral
I am not exactly sure how you can use gang violence to support your claim.;negative
Gang violence usually occurs because gang members are always looking for a fight, it is not some regular dispute that just gets out of hand.;negative
Eliminating gun free zones will not cause more gang violence.;negative
Police reduce gang violence.;neutral
No one's saying they will, but if everyone does, then all disputes will be handled with them.;negative
(1),(2),(3) I could go on all day, just google fights, or go to youtube.;negative
They limit it, if their was no law on drugs anyone that wanted to use, would use.;negative
18?;neutral
Any 18 year old in high shcool, can buy a gun.;neutral
WHen they get into a fight, they can use that gun.;negative
No I'm saying if we eliminate gun free zones, the people who carry their guns naturally will no have no reason not to carry them into these places.;negative
Gang violence is supporting the claim that if people have guns, they will use them when altercation arrive.;neutral
So you think gangs stand for fighting?;neutral
No, they are trying to make money.;neutral
You think gangs like Bloods, and Crips?;negative
I think gangs like The Mafia.;neutral
When they are having a deal with someone, they are not looking for a fight, but if one breaks out, think guns won't be used.;negative
True, gang violence will happen regardless, but eliminating gun free zones will allow more people to openly carry guns in more places, where if a physical argument happens, a gun will be used.;negative
That is the scenario you are arguing.;neutral
I don't have time to look at those right now, can you just tell me when the guns get pulled out so I can fast forward to that exact time?;negative
That would help.;neutral
It is basically illegal to use a gun pretty much anywhere.;neutral
How does a less enforceable law prevent more violence?;neutral
21 for handguns, sorry.;negative
That is not the problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;negative
Since when did the presence of a gun cause someone to die.;neutral
It is the USE of the gun.;neutral
The gun being used is just as illegal, and it would be as illegal as carrying a gun in a gun free zone, until you start detecting for guns.;negative
This is an example of a group of people who want to commit violence so they go get guns, not the other way around.;negative
It does not apply to you.;negative
I am really glad the Mafia will not bring guns into a gun free zone because they respect the law so much.;negative
You have no reason to believe this is true.;neutral
Plus, it is safer having people carrying guns currently.;negative
Note, those 2 statements are different.;negative
I am saying that if the guns are in people's pockets they will use them!;neutral
How do you not see that?!;neutral
Why on Earth would I put shootings on youtube?;negative
These are fights where people do whatever they can to win that is the nature of all fights!;negative
You are trying to get them to be legal everywhere, I'm trying to keep what we already have.;negative
Yes, but 18 years old for a shotgun or rifle.;neutral
That will be used if the situation calls for it!;neutral
If any dispute happens they will use them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;neutral
You completely ignored my point yet again.;negative
The gangs like The Mafia are not abiding by the law, that was not the point, the point is that, The Mafia is just trying to do business, but when something goes wrong they have guns, and they use them.;negative
Any regular Joe could be just doing business then when something goes wrong, he will use his gun.;negative
People get stabbed when a knife is nearby during an argument, that is my reason to believe this.;negative
How about when you quote, you quote the entire sentence?;neutral
A law for gun free zones is just as effective as the law to not shoot someone, therefore, there is no need for gun free zones as they are currently implemented.;negative
I don't believe your responses deserve to be recognized any more until they start to be based in reality.;negative
If it was legal to shoot someone, you better believe that it would happen more often.;negative
Yea that's good, because the way you misquote them, we're not getting anywhere.;positive
No shit Sherlock, you want a fucking cookie?;negative
Were you born this dumb, or does it take practice?;negative
This is why guns will never get banned in America, the other side is so fucking dumb, hahahahahahahahaha;negative
What's worse, misquoting someone or making incredibly stupid arguments like you do?;negative
I did not misquote you or misrepresent what you said.;negative
The stuff you said really is as fucking stupid as you thought when you reread it.;negative
Okay we have a point of argument finally.;neutral
All bold and italics so you'll actually read it.;positive
If it's illegal to shoot people, and shooting people still happens, then why make it illegal?;negative
Because it lowers the number of people getting shot.;positive
This is the same case with gun free zones.;neutral
I have yet to make a stupid argument they were all scenarios ground perfectly in fact and proof.;negative
You have yet to quote me properly, so i'd have to say it's you.;negative
Fuck you, this has to be a false statement.;negative
If we make a law that bans lollypops will that lower gun deaths, no.;negative
A law that bans guns in an area will mean that there will be less guns in that area.;negative
Period, end of story.;positive
Any other implications from that require FACTS.;negative
You know, those things you have yet to provide.;neutral
Newtown is proof that gun free zones DON'T reduce gun death, therefore you argument is wrong, you lose.;negative
The ONLY reason why people aren't gunned down in gun free or not zones is because shooting people is wrong/illegal.;negative
Sorry Charlie, all of you scenarios were based on your opinion, not what actually happens in real life.;negative
You either made an outrageous statement or went too far and made other things legal that are not on the table.;negative
Really?;neutral
What are we children?;neutral
Mind me for saying it, but you're an idiot.;negative
If their is a law against suckers, their will be less suckers.;negative
If there is a law against guns there will be less guns.;negative
That is a fact, it's undeniable.;positive
Obviously some people will still keep suckers, and some people will keep guns, but their will be less.;negative
You even said that if it was legal to shoot people that shootings would increase, why does it not register with you that if it's illegal to shoot people that shooting will decrease?;negative
There had never been a gun death there before this big incident, if it the gun free zones did not exist, people would carry them all the time whenever, and if any dispute had happened, the incident would have happened sooner.;negative
So in real life, people don't do whatever they can to win a fight?;negative
That is balderdash.;neutral
You are an asshole.;neutral
It is usually hard for assholes to accept that.;neutral
So, let it sink in and try not to deny it.;negative
You make false statements and accuse people of saying false things when they aren't.;negative
Then you act superior if it gets brought up to you.;positive
I win , I win , I win.;positive
You lose.;neutral
That was my point you dumb mother fucker.;negative
"How does someone with your intelligence breath much less make ""arguments""?";neutral
Banning guns in gun free zones will reduce the number of guns in that area, not reduce the number of gun deaths, just like you have said.;negative
IT IS ILLEGAL TO SHOOT PEOPLE YOU DUMB PRICK.;negative
Banning lollypops and banning guns in special zones has the same effect on whether someone will use a gun.;negative
But, we know that if someone else is around with a gun they can stop the shooter.;negative
Balderdash is precisely why I disagree with you.;positive
"There are less actual deaths, yet you can just say ""whatever, I believe in something else for no reason, and I will not justify with any proof"" Obviously you didn't say that word for word.";negative
It is more of your attitude.;neutral
I don't want to be accused of misquoting you again.;negative
And you are a child.;neutral
It is hard for children to accept that people have different opinions than them, and they act out and resort to name calling.;negative
I should have known by avatar you chose to represent you.;neutral
You want to quote me correctly on when I was acting superior?;negative
I'm sure I can quote you correctly on when you began acting like a spoiled child.;positive
My suspicions are confirmed.;neutral
All of the rest of that paragraph is slander, i won't quote that.;negative
Bear with me, let's go from here.;neutral
If lollipops are illegal, not all the lollipops will be gone, but most of them will be.;negative
If guns zones exist.;neutral
Less guns will be in those places.;neutral
That's the most correct statement you've made since you joined this site.;neutral
You are misquoting me, by paraphrasing, when you actually don't have an understanding of what i'm saying.;negative
Here....is...what...I'm...saying!;negative
If their is a rule against guns in an area, there will be less guns in that area.;negative
If there is no rule about guns in an area, there ill be more guns in that area.;negative
I don't have to accept incredibly fucking stupid remarks, like the ones you presented previously.;negative
Apparently I am the only one who thinks they are superior to children.;negative
Isn't calling someone a child demonstrating that they are acting superior?;negative
I learned something today, I should think twice before I properly quote sociopaths in the future.;negative
slander;neutral
Ding, ding, ding, the new dumbest statement in the history of CreateDebate.;positive
What prize do we have for him Johnny?;neutral
Describing my paragraph as slander is insane.;negative
Fuck you again.;positive
You are a fucking liar.;neutral
You said there will be less gun death.;neutral
If you misquote you, what do you expect from me?;neutral
Who says you have to accept it?;neutral
When you become an adult you'll realize people have different views and you'll accept that realization.;positive
It's a statement.;positive
If I call a white person white, my race does not matter, if they are white.;negative
Children, curse, and scream, and overact when faced with difficulty, like you are doing.;negative
If there is less gun usage there will be less gun death.;negative
You didn't take my new vantage point.;negative
Hmm, interesting turn of events.;positive
Not actually an argument.;neutral
Not actually an argument.;neutral
But, assholes release shit into the environment, so my assessment of you as an asshole is warranted apparently.;negative
Not actually addressing my comments.;positive
Not that it is clear that you ever did.;neutral
It looks like this is winding down.;negative
Probably a good thing, I think I hurt you with my facts, and it appears you only act normal when the other person acts like a child.;negative
Also because it was basically the same thing, I would provide logic, facts, and common sense, and you would come back with exaggerations, false claims, idiotic fantasies, and worthless gut feelings.;negative
You haven't addressed any of my points, in I can't remember how long.;negative
I won't add anything I'll just start over.;negative
Gun zone areas equal less guns in those areas.;negative
Dispute.;neutral
FALSE.;neutral
Every time I did you would get crazier.;negative
So then I had to stop.;negative
It doesn't accomplish anything to get rid of guns.;negative
No lives will be saved (in fact more lives will be lost), and no violence will be prevented.;negative
So, what is the point?;neutral
Removing guns leads to pain and suffering.;negative
Proof you are neglecting my point.;neutral
I stated simply In gun free zones, guns will be used less.;negative
Here is the problem we are having.;negative
You are saying there will be less guns available.;neutral
Then you are specifically saying that guns will be used less.;neutral
Those 2 things mean something totally different.;negative
I don't believe the USE of guns will be reduced just because it is a gun free zone.;negative
Example, school shootings.;neutral
I am only saying, from a brand new topic, that in gun free zones guns will be used less.;negative
Did you not agree that if shooting people was legal that more shootings would occur?;negative
I am saying that having a gun free zone does not guarantee that guns will not be used.;negative
I realize that you are not saying it is guaranteed either.;negative
I don't think guns will be used less in a gun free zone either because of the examples of guns not being stopped in current gun free zones.;negative
A gun free zone does not ban shooting people.;negative
That is already banned.;negative
Shooting people is not any more or less banned in a gun free zone.;negative
The ONLY thing that is implied by a gun free zone is that it will have less guns.;negative
Any other implications that you suggest need to be supported for people to agree with your statement.;negative
True, but no preventive measure 100% guarantees anything.;negative
What they do is lower the chances that what they are preventing, will occur.;negative
With no evidence either way I believe this is a moot point.;negative
My logic is from a standpoint that if there is no law preventing something it happens more often, so if there is a law preventing something it must slow it.;negative
All I asked was did you not agree with me that if there was no law against shooting people, that more people would get shot.;negative
Gun free zones don't lead to guns being stopped.;negative
Guns wouldn't be used either way.;negative
The gun free zones create a target which then causes guns to actually be used.;neutral
I said you have no evidence.;negative
Why are there gun shootings in gun free zones if gun free zones work?;negative
That is my evidence that guns will still be used.;neutral
My stance was clear on this.;neutral
I already agreed with you, then I pointed out that it doesn't matter because we are not talking about THAT law.;negative
You agreed that I was right that more people die because of gun free zones then are saved.;negative
You misquoted me.;neutral
This is a blatant misquote and I demand an apology.;negative
I don't see a misquote, I went through and I see that i responded to every issue aptly.;negative
Yet if you feel it's a practice that should be taken up, maybe it should start with you, show me where I misquoted you.;negative
How do you not see the misquote?;neutral
You did it deliberately.;neutral
I thought it was your job to find it.;positive
Do you consider yourself a standard hypocrite or a mega hypocrite.;negative
"I said: ""Somehow banning guns is the thing that will finally do it.""";neutral
"You said: ""As I said before, no one is trying to take your guns.""";negative
I clearly did not say or imply that you were talking about taking away all guns.;negative
Bam!;neutral
Misquote;neutral
I don't consider myself a hypocrite.;negative
A hypocrite says one thing but does another thing.;negative
I have always been in favor of finding your own mistakes, while you have always been in favor of finding the mistakes in question and bringing them to the attention of the person making them.;positive
I searched for my mistakes found none, and am content, I made none.;negative
Now is your turn to do as you said you'd like to do, and find my mistakes to bring to my attention.;negative
You literally said that you think guns should be banned.;neutral
Where I responded that we are not trying to take your guns.;negative
But you did, so not misquoted.;neutral
Thanks for bringing it to my attention.;positive
i still disagree with the method but it appears to be effective.;neutral
It is incredible that you can string together letters to make words you are so dumb.;positive
A gun free zone bans guns without taking them away.;negative
The debate is about gun free zones.;neutral
I mentioned banning guns IN GUN FREE ZONES.;negative
YOU DON'T LOOK FOR YOUR OWN MISTAKES.;negative
So, I guess you are saying you are mega.;negative
The gun free zones are not taking your guns, you still have your legal right to them.;negative
Gun free zones just don't want them in their areas.;negative
That's like nude free zones.;negative
You can be nude as you want in your home but not when entering a nude free zone.;neutral
This is what a ban is (we are talking about just the gun free zone now).;negative
Guns are banned in gun free zones.;neutral
Did I just now say that that means people who support gun free zones want to take away peoples guns?;neutral
No, I am now and have always only been talking about gun free zones.;neutral
You misquoted me by implying that I accused you of trying to take all guns.;negative
The whole point of this debate was to discuss whether gun free zones should be done away with.;negative
This has nothing to do with trying to get more gun rights.;negative
Gun owners are perfectly fine with gun free zones, and as can be seen currently, don't violate this rule because they think it is stupid.;positive
You said the only reason to keep gun free zones was because of peace of mind for the people who don't like guns.;neutral
You also said that they should have their peace of mind even if it kills them and the pro gun people should leave them alone.;negative
I tried to point out to you that everything scary about guns is illegal, so adding on the ban is false peace of mind.;negative
The rest of your arguments were you blatantly misrepresenting the future if gun free zones are lifted, and misrepresenting that gun owners are carrying their guns illegally.;negative
You constantly mentioned how guns would be used if gun free zones are lifted, but couldn't describe why it doesn't happen now in the gun friendly zones.;negative
Then you started blatantly using the wrong words and jumping to conclusions with different words.;neutral
This is not a ban, if the guns were never allowed there then nothing has changed.;negative
Obviously it was allowed at some point.;negative
Once the area was declared a gun free zone guns became banned in that area.;neutral
Really?;neutral
So schools, movie theatres, shopping malls, airports, etc, all used to allow guns before incidents like the Sandy Hook Shooting happened?;negative
Wrong, wrong wrong wrong.;negative
You have no idea what government is actually intended for do you?;neutral
It's not to protect us, that's our own personal responsibility.;negative
Government is there to provide a stable structure to society, and provide for relations with foreign societies, be they friendly or hostile.;negative
Furthermore, it is there to protect a person's liberty, or in other words, the free exercise of their natural rights.;negative
Government is NOT intended to be a nanny, nor can it possibly accomplish that role with any efficiency anyway.;negative
Individuals are far more capable and effective at doing that.;positive
Perhaps you should learn a little bit about US history and government.;neutral
Actually they are, and they're on record saying so, and they're not ashamed of it.;positive
So don't try to tell me otherwise.;negative
As for peace of mind, why do the anti-gun people have to take OUR Peace of Mind from us?;negative
I would sleep far more comfortably if I knew everyone in my nation owned and carried a loaded gun everywhere they went, including myself.;negative
Why can't the anti-gun people let me have MY Peace of Mind by arming themselves?;negative
So what your suggesting is that we need more gun free zones, since you think they work so well.;neutral
Gun free zones only prevent honest law abiding citizens from taking their guns into them.;negative
When, in the history of mankind, has anyone ever trusted a criminal to obey laws?;neutral
Signs, and more signs that create gun free zones do nothing.;positive
We can not expect criminals to obey the honor system.;negative
How about let's just not abolish the ones we already have.;negative
How about we do, since they do not work.;neutral
The theater in Aurora was a gun free zone, so were all of the schools.;negative
They prove not to work, if anything they do the opposite of what they were intended to do.;neutral
Let me offer you this scenario, though i already know your answer.;neutral
A crazed gunman with no particular target starts shooting people up in a movie theatre, several armed civilians pull out their guns in an attempt to be a hero, no one knows where the 1st shot was fired from so everyone starts firing at anyone they see with a gun.;negative
Does that sound better than ducking and covering, while the madman looks for people, then the police arrive to take him away?;negative
Although that scenario is extremely improbable and highly unlikely, lets assume that it is possible.;negative
We will say that 10 people with guns, which includes the original shooter, stand up and start shooting.;negative
They will all be shooting at people with guns.;negative
The amount of people shot will still be far less than the amount shot if only the original shooter had a gun.;negative
Now for the reality: People with concealed handgun permits have to go through training as well as a background check that is very extensive.;negative
They are extremely unlikely to pull out their gun and simply start shooting randomly.;negative
Yes but their are people in the crossfire, and their is also the people the original shooter was shooting, there is also the fact that, just like police brutality, people often abuse their power.;negative
A racist that's carrying a gun legally could take a mass shooting as his opportunity to take out a few members of a group he never liked.;negative
Your arguments are becoming very far-fetched.;neutral
Remember that the percent of law-abiding concealed carry holders who end up committing crimes of violence are less than 1/10 of .1%.;negative
It's because I already went over all of this with Cartman.;negative
That .1% would be lower in areas where guns are already not allowed.;negative
Strange then, that it's the places in America with the tightest gun control and most amount of gun free zones that have the highest gun criminal rate, whereas places with the least gun control have the lowest overall crime rate.;negative
Please explain this, the facts do not match up with your claims.;negative
Then based off of this.;neutral
Since gun control causes people to kill with guns more, murder being illegal makes people kill more.;negative
So we actually should eliminate gun free zones to cut down on the gun crimes, and also make murder no longer a crime to cut down on those too.;negative
We need to keep gun free zones, and make them more strict.;negative
The policy now is like telling people they can't have guns, with no method of ensuring that they won't.;negative
In fact that's literally what it is.;neutral
Your argument is faulty, there is no correlation between the two premises, but I'm sure you knew that already.;negative
It's not the fact that Murder is illegal that deters it's practice, it's the likelihood of getting caught and the harsh penalties that will inevitably ensue because of getting caught that factors into the criminal's decision to act or not.;negative
This is precisely why looser/no gun control works as a crime deterrent while gun-free zones are an attractant to criminal activity.;negative
"It works as a crime deterrent because the potential punishment for committing crime just rose up to the death penalty, and the potential for getting caught also increases dramatically, because there are more ""police"" (armed civilians) around that can catch the criminal in the act and stop him (it's easier to catch a fleeing target who's wounded by a gunshot than one who is unharmed).";negative
"With gun control, a criminal has a better chance of getting away because there are fewer ""police"" around that could wound and catch him, and the penalty for getting caught is up to the courts, and most likely NOT the death penalty.";negative
"Furthermore, in gun free zones, a criminal can wield considerable ""force of arms"" over the civilians with even the simplest of weapons (knife or pistol).";negative
Because the civilians have no method of defending themselves, and the police are way off somewhere else, a criminal can force compliance by threatening their life, and being able to back it up, whereas a place with armed citizens, the firepower is equal or favoring the citizen and the criminal runs the risk of injury or death by attempting to bring to bear his weapon in such an instance.;negative
Hey, I could support that!;neutral
So long as it's entirely voluntary for both zones, and no services are exclusive to either zone.;negative
I could totally support putting all the people offended by guns in special gun free zones, just for them.;negative
That way when one of the pro-gun people snaps, they can just walk into the no-gun zone, obviously hiding their gun, and have a blast shooting fish in a barrel.;negative
:3 Maybe then you guys would realize how utterly useless gun-free zones really are.;negative
I understand your good intentions but, I see it would be safer to always keep one handy.;negative
"It's come to my attention that this debate is virtually the same as the ""abortion"" or ""Gay rights"" topic.";negative
More the gay rights oen here's why.;negative
Heterosexual couples can marry, they are not being prevented in any way, yet they want it to be illegal for gays to marry even though I would not affect them in any way.;negative
People that want guns, can still own their guns, they just can't own them in the gun free areas.;negative
yet they want the gun free areas gone, even though it would not affect them in any way.;negative
"Actually it dose affect us of we should happen to find our selves in one of these ""gun free zones"" and a shooting occurs while we are unarmed and vulnerable well idd say that would effect us quite a bit.";negative
Leave!;positive
You don't have to live in those areas.;negative
It's like this.;neutral
Owning a gun is a responsibility right?;neutral
Well part of that responsibility is finding where you can own a gun.;neutral
Once you know it, just remember it and don't go into their places.;negative
Let them be idiots and restrict gun control in their places, while you're safe with your guns in your places.;negative
I'm talking about gun free zones such as schools, malls, movie theaters, ect places that you will inevitably enter at some point in your life.;negative
Gun free zones are usually buildings in which fire arms are not permitted not entire housing developments or whatever you where thinking of.;negative
Well those places should have a check of people as soon as they enter, to maintain the gun free zone-ness.;negative
I don't mean a full on body cavity search or whatever the airport does but a simple pat down by whatever security they have their.;negative
If those were in place then that would make the gun free zone more effective but I see 2 problems with your idea.;negative
1.;neutral
Do you really want to be patted down just so you can go to class, go to a movie, or go shopping?;negative
Yeah that would make the policy enforceable at least but doesn't that seem slightly... Orwellian?;negative
2 will there be armed security on scene to prevent the shooter from pulling his gun and firing on the people doing the patdowns?;neutral
"Or just firing in the line as there will certainly be a line if you must wait while the people ahead of you in the ticket line or the kid who got off the bus before you gets patted down and we all know how busy malls are now consider that you must wait in line to enter to ensure that everyone is safe to enter (make that three problems) and in the cases of the privetly owned properties that chose to be ""gun free zones""(movie theaters, malls, restaurants, office buildings, etc) will the armed security work for the owner or the government or a privet security contractor company I mean in the schools they will be government employees obviously but what about in other places?";neutral
"And how will you ensure that every ""gun free zone"" has these measures in place?";neutral
(tie in to my last question);neutral
As I said, I wouldn't want that, but if it's be patted down or potentially shot by a hero with a gun, I'll take the light pats anyday.;negative
Most security for places already have weapons.;neutral
The local high school near where I live have two armed officers.;neutral
I'd copy paste the rest but you know it all;neutral
The malls would present a problem, but what's to say the people that wanted to shoot up the place will be capped by any of the gun toting civilians that pop up.;neutral
What if the first person gunned down is the only person with a gun that could have saved the people, now the law of it being a gun free zone or not doesn't matter, but the people never got that peace of mind that gun free zones should exist, and they are now vying to get all guns banned rather than some areas gun free.;negative
"what if the first person to get capped is the only one with a gun well first off if you want to play the ""what if"" game than what if its the shooter that gets shot first?";neutral
.;neutral
And second think of all the people in a mall or movie theater or school, restaurant, office building, etc what are the odds given how many gun owners there are in America and how Many of them have concealed carry licenses and practice concealed carry that only one man would be armed.;negative
Besides you never answered my question about security in privately owned facility's.;negative
as to your point about the security in your local high school it's good to know that there are armed personnel standing by but as I've said idd rather the teachers be armed and trained so the officers can go back out on the streets where they are most needed.;negative
And as to your first point.;neutral
You may be fine with being patted down god knows how many different times while running errands or any time you want to take your girl or kid to a movie.;negative
But it would ware thin on me.;negative
And your more likely to get shot by the man firing indiscriminately than you are to be shot by the man aiming specifically at the man who is firing indiscriminately potentially getting shot by a hero with a gun don't think you got that clever remark past me.;negative
Or where you calling mass shooters heroes?;neutral
I hope not.;neutral
Who'd shoot the shooter?;neutral
A person who was carrying their gun in the no gun zone, that person would then be, the shooter, and the issue starts over.;negative
It was just a hypothetical, but then there's the issue of one shooter, versus tons of 'heroes'.;negative
All the vigilantes trying to shoot that one shooter, and the one shooter not caring about any life just killing, while all the vigilantes are trying to kill one person, not caring who gets in their way, and not caring about the paperwork they'll have to take care of after killing any number of people to get to the shooter.;negative
Then the police finally show, and they now don't know who's the shooter and who's a vigilante.;neutral
I'll address that after this, in a clarification, sorry.;positive
This is a brand new element that I'm perfectly in favor of.;positive
I'd much rather trained personnel with guns that random Joes.;negative
Would it wear thin with the first scenario, up above, that I mentioned?;negative
By that I mean, the hero with a gun is the guy trying to fire at the criminal with a gun, and misses.;negative
Xd, hell no.;negative
Many gun owners often train extensively with their firearms the scene you described is not likely.;negative
Most gun owners are pretty damn accurate otherwise what's the point of buying the gun in the first place.;negative
Here's how it would play out gun man walks in, gunman pulls gun, Guzman shots 1 person, gunman gets lite up like the New York Christmas tree by 3 well practiced concealed carrying citizens.;negative
So, how do you prevent the security guards from snapping and shooting the people they're intended to protect?;negative
Something like Police Brutality.;neutral
I do not have to, the business owners would have their security that already work there trained to do so.;negative
Okay that is if they have security of course there will be those who will think all this is unnessisary and not implement it then we are back at square one.;negative
"I mean you could put government guards in there but that would be a logistical nightmare that would require you to know where every ""gun free zone"" in the nation is located and a massive tax hike (potential political suicide) so privet security is impossible to enforce and government security would be a complete nightmare to implement and likely result in an utter cock up.";negative
Check mate thanks for playing.;neutral
Interestingly Warrior is Anti Gay Marriage and Anti Abortion but hates the thought of Gun Restrictions being in place because that would be restricting his rights.;negative
He wants to suppress the rights of others whilst keeping his.;negative
This goes beyond just the constitutional right to bare arms (neither gay marriage nor abortion are mentioned in the bill or rights therefor they are not rights) its about safety.;negative
Safety that won't require more taxes of wire tapping an wont require good honest citizens to be disarmed.;neutral
Abortion and Gay marriage might not be mentioned specifically but there is mention of all people being treated equally so not treating Homosexuals and Heterosexuals equally is denying them their constitutional rights, womens right to vote is not specifically mentioned in the constitution would you take that away from them?;negative
Also you think teachers need to be armed as opposed to armed guards at schools but what about teachers who dont want to be armed?;neutral
"Would you take away their right to choose and insist that they are armed to make life ""safer""";positive
To your first question it is not a right for heterosexual couples to get married its just an excepted practice and NPR is it a right for homosexuals to bet married.;negative
Secondly if a teacher dose not want to be armed so se can defend her students then I purpose an armed security guard be hired for just her class and a portion of his salary be cut from the teachers salary since she forced the school (and subsequently the tax payers) to pay for this particular expense so she can shoulder some of the burden.;neutral
Heterosexual marriage is legally recognised, Homosexual marriage is not ergo Homosexuals are not being treated equally to Heterosexuals which is unconstitutional.;negative
You think that teachers should help pay for an armed guard if they do not want to be armed, so another persons rights you would trample over.;negative
How about we make gun owners pay the medical bills and funerals of everyone who is injured or killed when a gun is used irresponsibly or illegally?;neutral
My reason for making the teacher pay for the guard is because the guard was hired as a direct consequence of her decision.;negative
How dose me bieing a gun owner make me directly responsible for every death by firearm?;negative
It best to avoid strawman arguments they make you look stupid.;neutral
And the bill of rights says nothing about unequal treatment being unconstitutional (remember slavery was legal back when it was wrighten) the preamble dose but that's not where our rights are listed nice try though.;negative
The Constitution says every man should be treated equally just because that was ignored for many years doesn't mean the Hypocrisy has to continue, if it does it makes the whole thing worthless.;negative
Why have you strayed so far from the topic of this debate???????;neutral
I was trying to show Warrior that his rights as Gun owner should not suoercede those of other people, according to him the only rights Americans are allowed are those that are specifically mentioned in the Constitution so Gun ownership is a yes but equal rights for others is a no.;negative
The bill of rights is the document that lists the rights American citizens have.;negative
If its not in there it's not a right plain and simple.;negative
This is getting interesting but I think I've taken this debate too far off topic I will create a new one where the rights of American Citizens and ammendments to the bill and wether they are good or bad can be debated.;negative
I apologise for taking this debate so far off topic;neutral
You are wrong.;negative
Even if it is not listed, it is a right.;positive
Healthcare is a right and it is not listed.;positive
My thought exactly.;neutral
Ashman stay on topic.;neutral
This debate has nothing do with gay marriage and the fact that the bill of rights says nothing about it.;negative
The topic is should we abolish gun free zones;neutral
Could you please quote and specify where in the constitution it says that all people must be treated equally?;negative
I've read it numerous times and have never found such a phrase.;negative
Furthermore, marriage is not a constitutional right, it is a legal privilege.;negative
Women's right to vote actually IS specified in the constitution, because until it was, they were not permitted such a privilege.;negative
I think you need to go back to your US history class.;neutral
As for teachers needing to be armed.;neutral
I posit to them this choice.;neutral
Either be armed, trained, and willing to defend their students, or not be hired in the first place.;negative
They have the right to choose to accept the job, with all the conditions enumerated, or to decline and find some other job.;positive
They do not however, have a right to have that job, particularly if they disagree with the enumerated conditions.;negative
14th ammendment equality clause and the original constitution as written by the founders states that all men are created equally with certain unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that was from a quick google search.;positive
I think your the one who needs to go back to class.;neutral
Please point out to me where in a teachers contract it says they must be armed also new contracts could only apply to new teachers what about the ones already employed who are opposed to being armed, you cant sack them because that would be unfair dismissal.;negative
lol?;neutral
The Original Constitution says that?;neutral
What original?;neutral
You mean the Articles of Confederation?;neutral
I'm pretty sure they don't.;negative
And if you mean the US Constitution, you are just as equally incorrect.;negative
Don't try to lecture me on the US Constitution, I have a copy of it right right next to me on my Desk.;negative
You are absolutely ignorant if you think the Constitution said that, and proved it when you state so matter-of-factly that you used google to find this out.;neutral
"The Document that actually says that is ""The Declaration of Independence,"" Which I also have a copy of on my desk.";negative
The 14th amendment furthermore also states nothing of the sort relating to equal treatment, and you would know that if you had actually read what it says.;negative
It simply states that all people born or naturalized in the United States are citizens and afforded equal PROTECTION by the law and shall not have such protections abridged.;negative
That's not equal treatment.;negative
So, you still haven't answered my question.;negative
"I asked specifically where in the Constitution is states that ""all people must be TREATED equally.""";neutral
Being treated equally and being created equally, are two very different things.;positive
As is being treated equally and having equal protection under the law, and if you don't understand that, I'm afraid you might need to go back to English class.;negative
As for teachers contract, I can point to no such thing, because we were discussing a hypothetical situation, not actual reality.;negative
"However, in My State, we have ""right to work"" protection, which means either party of the job contract can sever the contract at any time for whatever reason they desire.";neutral
There's no such thing as unfair dismissal.;negative
In the hypothetical situation we are discussing, and in real life of course, all parties under contract would have provisions made into their contract stating that new policies would require a re-negotiation of the contract.;negative
So, obviously, when the school changes their policies, they offer the teachers re-negotiation under a new contract, otherwise if they disagreed with the new contract after negotiation, they would be free to leave employment.;negative
Apologies, I see now that you're from the UK, so I can't expect you to have as capable an understanding of the US Constitution as an American Citizen should.;positive
I'm sorry for the mistake.;negative
However, my point still stands.;neutral
Accepted now you understand my reliance on the internet on some things and I apologise for my sarcastic response below.;negative
Equal treatment under law how does that not mean not having equal rights or not being treated equally, please explain as I am obviously of a lower intellect as you;negative
Equal Protection, PROTECTION, under the law.;negative
Not equal treatment.;neutral
That's the difference.;neutral
Equal protection means that the laws are not unfavorably skewed to exclude you.;negative
What is critical to understand about the US Constitution is that it is intended to protect the natural rights inherently attributed to all people in the Declaration of Independence.;negative
Life, liberty, and property (the pursuit of happiness in attaining and using material goods and services).;positive
This then means, in the context of equal protection, that all citizens of the US will be equally protected in their ability to exercise these 3 rights and all others subsequent to them, without coercion or interference by government.;negative
And what is necessary to accomplish that, is to ensure these rights can not be taken away except through the due process of law, which accounts for many of the Rights listed in the Bill of Rights, forbidding from government power to cut around due process (rights of the accused), infringe on liberty (freedom of religion and speech), and remain subject to the Sovereign People (right to bear arms);negative
Equal protection then means that the due process of law shall not be altered for any party, nor shall the natural liberties people enjoy be infringed.;negative
In historical context, the 14th amendment came about because certain states were intentionally making requirements to vote which the newly freed previously enslaved negro could not possibly meet, such as high taxes and literacy tests.;negative
Thus denying them of their right as a citizen to vote, without due process.;positive
The negro was guilty of nothing but being different, and yet being denied their rights, hence, equal protection of rights granted by the 14th.;negative
Equal TREATMENT on the other hand, as you seemed to imply earlier, was to be mandated for everyone to practice.;negative
Everyone must be treated the same and granted the exact same things.;negative
No one can own more property than another, groups can not be taxed at different rates, subsidies must apply to all industries and all businesses in those industries, females must be able to work all jobs men can work, bathrooms can not discriminate by gender, all people must have a driver's license, etc. stuff like that.;negative
The example you used: gay marriage (ignoring the complete misnomer there):;negative
You said it is not equal treatment to prevent gays from being married.;negative
Besides the fact that marriage is not a right in the first place and thereby not subject to equal protection, it already applies equally to all citizens:;negative
Any unmarried male is permitted to marry any unmarried female, not too closely related by blood, or outside of statutory age limits, and any unmarried female is permitted to marry any unmarried male, within those same restrictions.;negative
This does not prohibit gays from marrying at all.;negative
Any gay is perfectly legally permitted to marry any member of their opposite gender, just as equally as straight men and women are.;positive
The law makes no exceptions except statute age, blood relation, and current marital status.;negative
Blacks, whites, gays, straights, men, women, etc, they're all free to marry their opposite gender.;negative
It is obvious to me now that I was causing confusion with my choice of words, I meant equal rights by treatment I meant no one should be getting preferential treatment due to gender, sexuality, colour etc, I didn't mean everyone should use the same kazy and no one should be allowed to own more stuff than another, what do you think I am some kinda Commie?;negative
:);neutral
"Democrat Liberal Socialist actually, based upon your views for gun control, gay ""marital"" unions, and your choice of words.";positive
As well as your complete ignorance of the US Constitution :P;neutral
Yes, I came to the realization that this might have been a misunderstanding as I tried to explain the differences.;negative
Yes, the US Constitution affords equal rights to every natural born, or naturalized citizen, and as such, they are treated equally under the law (or supposed to be anyway).;negative
Some laws are unfair, however, the majority of them don't explicitly infringe on the natural rights of We the People, so they're perfectly acceptable legally.;negative
Anything that is a legal benefit is not a right however, and does not apply under equal application, protection, or treatment of the law.;negative
But, perhaps we should get back to gun control now...;neutral
More guns = less crime.;negative
:);neutral
The more i've pondered guns I can see that would be impossible to ban Guns in America and I am not totally anti guns but I do believe there should be stricter laws on ownership/background checks or the existing ones should be made stricter or be better enforced but if people are refused a gun they should be given the reasons why and be able to appeal.;negative
This might hopefully keep legal weapons out of the hands of idiots and the dangerous and prevent school shootings at least those done by the owners of legal weapons.;negative
I think the way to get workable laws in place is if sensible gun owners helped with coming up with sensible laws instead of knee jerk opposition to anything that anyone suggests and to be honest some of the idiots speaking up in defence of guns dont help the gun owners cause, one of the best things the NRA did was cut its ties with Ted Nugent but some of the stuff he was coming out with just made him look like a loon, to an outsider you see that and think if thats the best person they could come up with for a spokesperson the rest must be really nuts.;negative
I should certainly hope it would be possible, but I'm not going to put anything past these anti-gun proponents, because they are not going to stop if they aren't made to.;negative
To them, everything is a step towards total prohibition and confiscation of all guns.;negative
"Once they have this step, because it obviously won't work, they'll demand another step, more restrictive than the last, and then another, until ultimately guns are banned entirely, gun production is relegated solely to the military, and every loose gun in the hands of a civilian that can be found is confiscated (or ""bought"" by the government).";negative
Because the ultimate goal here is power, and control, through government, over the people.;positive
Some of the lesser proponents might just be misguided or brainwashed into thinking it'll be good for reducing crime, but the ones with legislative power working for gun control, are in it for the control.;negative
That's all government has ever been about and will ever be since it's formation, more and more control, until it has absolute control.;negative
That is why We are explicitly granted the protection from infringement on gun possession by the second amendment.;negative
Once a nation is disarmed, it is only a matter of time before they will be ruled by a supreme dictator and an unmatchable army.;negative
The only gun control I would support would be mandatory gun training, and prohibition for felons and the clinically insane.;negative
Background checks won't help much, because no known criminal would attempt to acquire a gun legally (they would either steal someone else's legally acquired gun, or buy off a black market), and most spontaneous gun crime is committed by people who have not not committed a previous offense.;negative
Sensible laws according to whom?;negative
IMO, anything that even remotely infringes on my right to own, and carry on my person (keep and bear), any arm of military strength (militia required for a free state) is unconstitutional, and should therefore be stopped.;negative
We've already made numerous concessions to the anti-gun crowd, concessions that ought not to be made, and yet they keep requiring more and more.;negative
We know what they're trying for (to completely disarm us), IMO, it's time to refuse to compromise any further the letter and spirit of the Constitution.;negative
There is too much gun violence in America.;negative
I wish guns were banned.;negative
Of course not!;neutral
Generally, it should ban the sale of guns to the population!;negative
Because so many cases of mass murder.;neutral
The most recent occurred in Belgorod, where 10 people were killed.;negative

We are only talking about non law enforcement, the civilians.;negative
Normal civilians with guns stop criminal civilians.;negative
Please address my previous argument with this in mind.;neutral
They do not need guns.;negative
Normal civilians with guns are known as vigilantes.;negative
They are illegal.;neutral
You are saying in this area it is illegal to carry a gun.;neutral

Civilians can't stop gunmen in the 1st place, criminal or otherwise.;negative
Were their police with guns in newtown?;neutral
Please tell me your being sarcastic.;negative
First of all gun free means just that no guns period how can that be any stricter?;neutral
Second all the stories told of instances when gun toting bystanders saved people thus proving that disarming citizens is a bad thing.;negative
when have those laws prohibiting kids from substances completely legal for adults ever worked?;neutral
First of all gun free means just that no guns period how can that be any stricter?;neutral
You know who else was a gun toting bystander?;neutral
The original shooter.;neutral
If they did searches of people that would have prevented the criminalistic gun toting citizens from shooting people, but as I said I don't want that.;negative
What next, a mandatory gun in every home!?!?;negative

Hey, that's illegal.;neutral
Are you afraid of being robbed at gunpoint?;neutral
Hey, that's illegal.;neutral
Are you afraid of being kidnapped by a gunman?;neutral
Hey, that's illegal.;neutral
Peace of mind is up to you.;positive
No ones trying to take your guns, why do gun lovers have to take the peace of mind from the people afraid of them?;negative
Give me an example of a gun being used legally that other people are afraid of.;negative
I addressed all of your argument with the bolded letters;neutral
Soldier and police use;neutral
Somehow banning guns is the thing that will finally do it.;positive
You want to have citizens not carry guns, and you consider the only ones you think should have guns as scary?;negative
That seems silly to me.;negative
This just shows your peace of mind argument is crap.;negative
So I repeat, you can have your guns, can the people who don't want guns have a place to not be around them?;negative
Apparently not.;negative
We give those to you and you get killed in them.;neutral
Then you blame us.;neutral
The gun lovers are not doing anything illegal.;negative
he gun lovers leave their guns at home when in gun free zones.;negative
Gun zones are not an exact science, obviously, but they are a solution to regular gun lovers getting upset, and firing off a round in their enemy's face!;negative
it would too happen;neutral
In schools;neutral
I think if more people could openly carry guns, that they would use them if a heated discussion ever took place.;negative
How do you explain the lack of gun violence in these confrontations in America.;neutral
Uh, no one is talking about giving the guns to the students.;negative
But, I agree we don't need kids to be armed.;neutral
I think arguments would not get heated then;neutral
The lack of guns;negative
A school....wait for it...;negative
The lack of guns;negative
A school....wait for it...;negative
misquoted me;neutral
hey won't use whatever they have to win;negative
And again you misquoted.;positive
gun will be used;neutral
The rest is all an attempt to belittle me, great logic by the way, and I don't even see a reason to respond to that.;positive
I meant that in America it is possible for basically anyone to have a gun on them.;neutral
LET ME SHOUT SO YOU CAN FINALLY HEAR ME.;negative
WHY DON'T WE SEE THIS ANYWHERE?;negative
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT THE SHOOTINGS HAPPENED IN A GUN FREE ZONE?;negative
Eliminating gun free zones means arming TEACHERS, not the students.;negative
You have no reason to believe that what I said won't happen;neutral
you need to stop using insane impossible situations;negative
that would clearly be happening if you were right that they were possible.;neutral
Possible doesn't mean that everyone does, it means that everyone can.;negative
Make no mistake, if everyone did have a gun on them, gun violence would increase as any minor dispute, moved to a hot enough temperature could involve the use of their firearm.;negative
It's the reason when you fight in a public place, people get slammed onto floors, knocked over chairs, pushed into objects.;negative
People, in the heat of the moment, will often do whatever it takes to win the fight.;neutral
In a fight, whatever can be done to win, will be done.;negative
That quote that you answered to, wrong.;negative
The shooting happened because one person didn't follow the rule, no one said gun free zones would eliminate gun violence.;negative
then anyone that can get a license for it;neutral
Same for you.;neutral
So gang violence involving guns are insane impossible situations?;negative
Anyone that has a gun will more than likely use it if a dispute does break out.;negative
Since when did abolishing gun free zones lead to everyone having a gun.;neutral
Obviously this is not true because we don't see it anywhere.;negative
That is my point, gun free zones don't prevent gun violence, therefore there is no reason to have them.;negative
We have restrictions on the age someone can own a gun.;negative
Those restrictions will not be lifted, you argument is invalid.;negative
You are saying that if we eliminate gun free zones, every man, woman, and child will have a gun on them.;neutral
I am not exactly sure how you can use gang violence to support your claim.;negative
Gang violence usually occurs because gang members are always looking for a fight, it is not some regular dispute that just gets out of hand.;negative
Eliminating gun free zones will not cause more gang violence.;negative
No one's saying they will;neutral
google fights;neutral
They limit it;neutral
Any 18 year old in high shcool, can buy a gun;neutral
carry them into these places;neutral
Gang violence;neutral
gangs stand for fighting;neutral
if a physical argument happens, a gun will be used;neutral
That is the scenario you are arguing.;neutral
I don't have time to look at those right now, can you just tell me when the guns get pulled out so I can fast forward to that exact time?;negative
That would help.;neutral
It is basically illegal to use a gun pretty much anywhere.;neutral
How does a less enforceable law prevent more violence?;neutral
21 for handguns, sorry.;negative
Since when did the presence of a gun cause someone to die.;neutral
I am really glad the Mafia will not bring guns into a gun free zone because they respect the law so much.;negative
You have no reason to believe this is true.;neutral
I don't believe your responses deserve to be recognized any more until they start to be based in reality.;negative
If it was legal to shoot someone, you better believe that it would happen more often.;negative
misquote them;neutral
What's worse, misquoting someone or making incredibly stupid arguments like you do?;negative
You have yet to quote me properly;negative
all scenarios ground perfectly in fact and proof;positive
Fuck you, this has to be a false statement.;negative
If we make a law that bans lollypops will that lower gun deaths, no.;negative
Newtown is proof that gun free zones DON'T reduce gun death,;negative
Sorry Charlie, all of you scenarios were based on your opinion, not what actually happens in real life.;negative
Really?;neutral
What are we children?;neutral
Mind me for saying it, but you're an idiot.;negative
If their is a law against suckers, their will be less suckers.;negative
If there is a law against guns there will be less guns.;negative
That is a fact, it's undeniable.;positive
Obviously some people will still keep suckers, and some people will keep guns, but their will be less.;negative
You even said that if it was legal to shoot people that shootings would increase, why does it not register with you that if it's illegal to shoot people that shooting will decrease?;negative
Newtown is proof that gun free zones DON'T reduce gun death,;negative
There had never been a gun death there before this big incident, if it the gun free zones did not exist, people would carry them all the time whenever, and if any dispute had happened, the incident would have happened sooner.;negative
Sorry Charlie, all of you scenarios were based on your opinion, not what actually happens in real life.;negative
So in real life, people don't do whatever they can to win a fight?;negative
That is balderdash.;neutral
You are an asshole.;neutral
It is usually hard for assholes to accept that.;neutral
Then you act superior if it gets brought up to you.;positive
I win , I win , I win.;positive
You lose.;neutral
That was my point you dumb mother fucker.;negative
I don't want to be accused of misquoting you again.;negative
different opinions than them;neutral
You want to quote me correctly on when I was acting superior?;negative
I'm sure I can quote you correctly on when you began acting like a spoiled child.;positive
That's the most correct statement you've made since you joined this site.;neutral
You are misquoting me, by paraphrasing, when you actually don't have an understanding of what i'm saying.;negative
Here....is...what...I'm...saying!;negative
If their is a rule against guns in an area, there will be less guns in that area.;negative
If there is no rule about guns in an area, there ill be more guns in that area.;negative
I don't have to accept incredibly fucking stupid remarks, like the ones you presented previously.;negative
Apparently I am the only one who thinks they are superior to children.;negative
Isn't calling someone a child demonstrating that they are acting superior?;negative
Fuck you again.;positive
You are a fucking liar.;neutral
You said there will be less gun death.;neutral
Who says you have to accept it?;neutral
When you become an adult you'll realize people have different views and you'll accept that realization.;positive
It's a statement.;positive
If I call a white person white, my race does not matter, if they are white.;negative
Children, curse, and scream, and overact when faced with difficulty, like you are doing.;negative
If there is less gun usage there will be less gun death.;negative
You didn't take my new vantage point.;negative
You haven't addressed any of my points;neutral
It doesn't accomplish anything to get rid of guns.;negative
You are saying there will be less guns available.;neutral
I don't believe the USE of guns will be reduced just because it is a gun free zone.;negative
I am saying that having a gun free zone does not guarantee that guns will not be used.;negative
I don't think guns will be used less in a gun free zone either because of the examples of guns not being stopped in current gun free zones.;negative
A gun free zone does not ban shooting people.;negative
True, but no preventive measure 100% guarantees anything.;negative
What they do is lower the chances that what they are preventing, will occur.;negative
With no evidence either way;neutral
All I asked was did you not agree with me that if there was no law against shooting people, that more people would get shot.;negative
Do you consider yourself a standard hypocrite or a mega hypocrite.;negative
"I said: ""Somehow banning guns is the thing that will finally do it.""";neutral
"You said: ""As I said before, no one is trying to take your guns.""";negative
I clearly did not say or imply that you were talking about taking away all guns.;negative
Bam!;neutral
Misquote;neutral
A hypocrite says one thing but does another thing.;negative
I have always been in favor of finding your own mistakes;neutral
The gun free zones are not taking your guns, you still have your legal right to them.;negative
Gun free zones just don't want them in their areas.;negative
It's not about my personal peace that these laws are in place, they are in place because the government is there to protect us.;negative
No ones trying to take your guns, why do gun lovers have to take the peace of mind from the people afraid of them?;negative
So what your suggesting is that we need more gun free zones, since you think they work so well;negative
Since gun control causes people to kill with guns more, murder being illegal makes people kill more.;negative
Do you really want to be patted down just so you can go to class, go to a movie, or go shopping?;negative
will there be armed security on scene to prevent the shooter from pulling his gun and firing on the people doing the patdowns?;neutral
what if its the shooter that gets shot first?;neutral
what are the odds;neutral
Besides you never answered my question about security in privately owned facility's.;negative
I've said idd rather the teachers be armed and trained;neutral
But it would ware thin on me;negative
potentially getting shot by a hero with a gun;positive
Or where you calling mass shooters heroes?;neutral
I hope not.;neutral
Most security for places already have weapons.;neutral
The local high school near where I live have two armed officers.;neutral
"And how will you ensure that every ""gun free zone"" has these measures in place?";neutral
(tie in to my last question);neutral
I think this is what they mean when they wrote the bill of rights:;neutral
From the NYT:;neutral
"""Today the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a politically charged challenge to the District of Columbia’s gun control laws.";positive
The case poses a vital question: can cities impose reasonable controls on guns to protect their citizens?;negative
"The court should rule that they can.""";neutral
From the Bill of Rights:;neutral
"""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""";positive
From my perspective, its pretty clear that guns in cities are not tied to militia service.;negative
Therefore, reasonable limits are acceptable.;positive
Definition of militia according to Princeton's WordNet: civilians trained as soldiers but not part of the regular army.;negative
"The first part of the second amendment (and the only part you cite) says ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.""";neutral
This basically says an army of civilians trained to like soldiers, but not actual soldiers, is necessary for our security.;negative
It's true, we should have civilians trained in the art of using weapons there for our security, instead of only relying on the police force or military our government provides us with.;negative
"The second part of the second amendment (the part you don't cite) says ""The right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.""";negative
This part says clear as day that we as people, have the right to not just keep our arms, but to also bear or use them.;neutral
This goes hand in hand with the first part because a militia of citizens can't be armed without this second part.;positive
If you read some quotes from the founding fathers, then you can see for yourselves just how they felt about owning guns.;positive
"""The Constitution shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.""";negative
- Samuel Adams;neutral
"""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.""";positive
-Thomas Jefferson;neutral
"""A free people ought to be armed.""";neutral

"""No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.""";negative

"as V said ""The people shouldn't fear their government, the government should fear their people"".";negative
look at Cuba, they can't revolt against their government because they have no weapons, so instead they all just come here, or whore themselves to American tourists.;negative
Our founding fathers gave us this right because the people must stay in control.;negative
the only way for the people to stay in control is to have superior strength.;positive
lets face it, in this day in age, that means superior fire power.;positive
Ah, V was quoting Thomas Jefferson.;negative
Are the people of Cuba very discontent?;neutral
I'm not contradicting you, I'm really wondering.;negative
"I had heard that this was American propaganda; The ""refugees"" who come here are simply in search of more money, due to a weak Cuban economy (caused by American policies in the first place).";negative
The Cuban I met said that most people there are pretty content with the way their country is run.;negative
"well, most of my family came from there ;).";positive
yeah, MOST hate it.;negative
i'm surrounded by them, and they all hate Castro and they all hate Communism.;negative
although, the ones who get here nowadays, even though they hate Castro's regime, still think in a communist way.;neutral
they're so used to it, that they don't know why they hate it there in the first place.;negative
they just know it sucks.;negative
how would you know if they dont like the way their country is run, they can t speak out like americans can;negative
People who think gun control actually works haven't begun to research the subject.;negative
"The worst shootings in recent history have taken place in so called ""gun free zones,"" like schools and post offices.";negative
This is because these shooters can do their thing practically unabated.;neutral

The video you presented is very persuasive.;positive
Guns serve the function of keeping everyone equal.;neutral
While it is the case that some people may use guns for malicious ends, if everyone had a gun, and assuming everyone wanted to preserve the peace, the risk of gun related violence would decrease.;negative
Here in the US the second amendment exist for one reason and one reason alone: Governments can always turn on the people.;neutral
Here it is in all of it's glory:;neutral
A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.;positive
Basically, the country needs an army to be a country, but the founders had just experienced their own country's army at the time (England) being used against them and taking away their weapons en masse.;negative
Therefore they enshrined the second amendment in the Bill of Rights just in case it ever became necessary to overthrown the government they created if it had lost its way.;negative
Yes, the founders ensured your ability to overthrown the government if that need ever arose.;negative
America, Fuck yeah.;positive
We will need those guns once the revolution starts.;negative

eh, maybe it's because it's mandatory?;negative
plus, we have waaay more people and have much more access to weapons than other large civilizations.;negative
this is probably why more of us need to be armed.;negative
but not enough of us are armed, so there's more murder.;negative

When governments no longer use weapons as an effective tool, then the people might consider giving up such things.;negative

Plus crime [b]WILL NOT[/b] and I mean [b]WILL NOT[/b] be lowered in fact it would increase and I know for a fact because it has been proving already by some places in England, they banned the use of firearms to civilians and now criminals know that they can break into a house and not worry about getting shot because they can get there hands on illegal fire-arms from trades and such forth and go into someones home put them at gun point and not worry about the civilian having a weapon to shoot back.;negative

"I think it is non-intuitive to state that an ""attack"" on one amendment or right included in the Bill of Rights is an attack on all of them.";negative
Many of the founding fathers who drafted the original ten amendments did not even consider them to be a single body of rights but did view them as being separate.;negative
"Furthermore, I do not think the arguments or evidence have been adequately provided to support the claim that the right to bear arms is not in fact ""broken"".";negative
I think that the concerns of anti-gun advocates have not been seriously addressed in a fashion that befits those concerns, particularly where the right to bear arms may be in direct conflict with the right to life (the latter of which I would argue trumps the former).;negative
Finally, to make my stance more explicit I am both a gun rights advocate and a regulation advocate.;neutral
Just as we embrace the right to free speech but restrict it where it conflicts with the public interest so to should the right to bear arms be subject to restriction.;positive
There is no reason it should have special exclusion from the same considerations to which all other rights are subjected.;negative
Okay, now I see where your coming from.;negative
That makes sense.;neutral
However, I still think that the way some advocates are going is way to much.;neutral
I don't think, for example, banning semi-auto weapons will decrease crime.;negative
The restriction is, in my opinion, a blatant violation of the second amendment.;negative
Yeah... I could have been clearer.;negative
That was probably my bad.;negative
Which tyrannical government, may I ask, are you and some hillbillies going to be able to defend against, which the U.S. military would not be able to defend against?;negative
I just find it curious that it is (not you necessarily) a majority overweight, under-educated, and frankly slow and not very physically capable individuals, who are the most convinced it is on them to protect the nation from some shadow force bent on our destruction.;negative
It's very, very odd.;negative
I don't want to play along with these idiots anymore.;negative
Pretend time is over, put your toys away.;negative
If you want a rifle to hunt or a regular hand gun, pass a background check and some mental tests and okay.;negative
If you want 30 clips and semi-automatic weapons, join the military.;negative
End of story.;neutral
No, it's not the end of the story.;neutral
It doesn't matter what tyrannical government that we defend against, it could be a foreign power invading gather U.S or the U.S. government.;negative
"And not all of us ""hillbillies"" are overweight and slow and undereducated, which is biased.";negative
I could say the same for you skinny jean, weed smoking, liberal, conservative haters.;negative
But, of course, that is a bias.;negative
Our right to own weapons is a constitutional right designed to keep the government in check.;positive
For example:;neutral
The recent Arab Spring shows that citizens with ak-47's can defeat tyrannical governments who have jets, bombs, rockets, and tanks.;negative
Look at Libya, Syria, and Tunisia.;neutral
They are redesigning the middle-east.;neutral
Our right to own weapons are integral for keeping our country free.;positive
You know why our government is so great?;positive
Because they know that we can overtake them.;positive
That's what the founding fathers designed the second amendment for.;neutral
"They didn't just think, ""Oh, and throw in that amendment because I want to go hunting!""";negative
.;neutral
No, it was made to defend and keep the government in check.;neutral
And by the way.;neutral
These are not toys.;negative
And if what liberals say about us gun owners being so violent is true, all you liberals would be dead a long time ago.;negative
You can take my gun from my cold, dead hands.;negative
Arab's governments are bunch of civilian with AK's so it's more less AK vs. AK plus two second world war tanks and 40 years old Mig.;negative
This cannot be applied to US with 17000 airplanes, 6000 modern tanks, submarines, battleships, 30 000 Tomahawks, about million soldiers.;negative
No way how bunch of Texas rednecks can compete.;negative
If you believe that the Arab governments are just a bunch of weak civilians, you show your utter ignorance in world events.;negative
Look at Syria, who has chemical weapons (which, thankfully, they have not used), rockets, many tanks, and rules the air in Syria.;negative
Israel had a tough time defeating them in the Yom Kippur War, and Syria has trained these weapons on their rebels, who are winning right now.;negative
Who says that if the citizens of the United States rebelled, the government would win?;neutral
Who says that only Texas would be fighting?;neutral
And would the military be willing to fight against its own citizens?;neutral
Look at the army desertions in Syria and Libya.;neutral
Syria has no proper army and never had, they have forces to surround only a single city, that's why they fight the way they do.;negative
Using second hand obsolete Russian technology mostly pre-cold war.;neutral
Libya is even weaker;neutral
How did they not have a proper army?;neutral
"What is defined as ""proper""?";negative
They have a strong military force that almost defeated Israel, which many countries can not claim, and they are now fighting their own citizens.;neutral
"Only some soldiers are ""trained"", majority just get clothes and a weapon,to became officer you just pay a ""fee"" or be a family member of an officer.";negative
They don't do any servicing to their armor.;negative
Combat tactics from movies.;negative
"Syria has no Army like western countries, it's more like smaller groups under rule of local ""general"", there are rivals between them also religious differences that makes them not really cooperating.";negative
I have lived in flat share with Syrian deserter/refugee...;neutral
"...""almost defeated Israel"" as Germany almost defeated Russia.";negative
Germany lost because of Hitler being an idiot.;negative
They had the best army in the world and he squandered it.;positive
I just can't see the US government completely wiping out a rebellion by the people.;negative
It's just not possible.;neutral
There are too many of people to put down.;negative
And a lot of soldiers would not be willing to fight.;negative
There very many studies, US soldiers would fight against US rebels, it wouldn't be long and chaotic like in Syria or Libya, US has proper Army with very advance intelligence system, easy to strike anywhere in mater of minutes.;positive
"On the other side, the rebels would be untrained disorganized rednecks similar to tribal ""Freedom"" fighters from Syria.";negative
Do you really think so that bunch of farmers in pickups would take over any US base?;negative
It's just a myth ...that you need your weapons to fight against tyrant government ...myth spread by weapon manufactures.;negative
It is not a myth.;negative
It has been around since the founding of the US, way before some gun manufacturer.;neutral
The founding fathers created the second amendment for the purpose of defending against the federal government should the need ever arise.;negative
You can look at their quotes about the bill of rights to confirm it.;neutral
"but it's horribly obsolete model, ""founding fathers"" lived in times when rifle was the only available weapon.";negative
"No you cannot defend against ""governmental terror"".";negative
Just weapon manufacturers makes you think that by buying multipack of AKs makes you somehow safer against Evil government's tanks, artillery, battleships, bombers, missiles, drones....;negative
are you really so dumb?;negative
I guess I am.;negative
I believe in history repeating itself, and I'm preparing myself for it.;negative
I think you resent us for owning weapons because we were the ones that kicked you out during the revolution.;negative
"I enjoy my rights, and I can defend against ""governmental terror"".";positive
I refuse to lie down and submit, which many did in Britain, Australia, and other countries.;negative
The government has put the thought into your head that you cannot resist them.;positive
"It's just like in the book ""1984"" (which, if you haven't read, is a good book that I recommend).";neutral
I'm not British, your belief is just infantile fallacy ....refuse to lay down?;negative
WTF are you talking about?;neutral
Your gov may hold you in prison indefinitely without evidence or tap you or torture without breaking any law, but you keep blabbing about cameras in UK (which has 1/5 of the No.;negative
"of cameras in US). """;neutral
"I believe in history repeating itself"" no it does not, that's why it's called history.";negative
If your not British, then why did you list yourself as from Wales in a previous debate?;neutral
Or do you consider yourself more Welsh than British?;neutral
Anyway, the gov. does not have the right to contain me without fair trial and evidence.;negative
Now, the President has that right if it is determined I am a threat to national security, or in a time of Marshall Law.;neutral
The gov. itself does not.;negative
I do believe I mentioned cameras only once, but I'll run with it.;positive
The only reason the US has more cameras than the UK is because we are a huge country with more people, resources, territory, etc.;negative
It's absurd though in the UK that there is one camera for every 3 people.;negative
The US doesn't have that kind of statistic and it doesn't need to.;negative
And, yes, history does repeat itself, many times.;negative
Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.;negative
I live in Wales, I'm not from Wales, I'm not British.;negative
not 3 but 32 people per camera and vast majority of them are private CCTV.;negative
You have 6x time more people but 22x more cameras so do the maths.;negative
Okay, that makes sense.;positive
Sorry for the assumption.;neutral
Anyway, the UK still has more cameras per capita than any other country in the world.;negative
I would feel like Big Brother is watching my every move.;negative
No, you didn't get it.;neutral
I blame your hillbilly genes/jeans skinny or baggy.;negative
Which government are you going to defend against which the U.S. government cannot defend against.;negative
Potentially, the U.S. Government.;neutral
That's what the 2nd amendment is for.;neutral
It guarantees the ability to enforce all the other rights.;positive
Government should be afraid of the people, not people afraid of the government.;negative
"And our military is made up of citizens just like you, it's a ""armed militia"" made up of citizens.";positive
The 2nd amendment was written when muskets were the only weapon around and when our government needed to recruit its citizens to defend itself.;negative
It doesn't anymore.;negative
Even if some insanity infected all of the military and they decided to attack their friends, parents, relatives for some unimaginable reason, as you seem to be implying, even should this impossible and ridiculous scenario happen, your guns and all of the guns of all of the citizens won't be able to do jack shit against fighter jets, tanks, drones, battleships, etc.;negative
It's a silly fantasy.;neutral
Our government shouldn't be scared of the citizens which make up the government, and the citizens that make up the government shouldn't be afraid of the government.;negative
It's ridiculous.;negative
So your argument is that they are so powerful, ANY weapons we have will be useless against them so we should not have weapons?;positive
Yes, the government should be VERY afraid of the citizenry.;negative
"""When governments fear the people, there is liberty.";negative
When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.;negative
"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.""";negative
-Jefferson;neutral
So you being as fearful of the government as you are, would be one of the first to support tyranny no doubt, wrapped in an american flag no doubt.;negative
That aside, again, muskets.;negative
They had muskets.;neutral
This is silly make believe land.;negative
Come back to the real world.;positive
If all of the United State's enemies invaded, like China, Russia, N.Korea, the Middle East, Cuba, and Venezuela, the combined force of the US military and the citizenry could put over 160 million people fighting back.;negative
If you take out the active US military, then that is 158 million armed citizens aged 17-49.;negative
Now tell me what country would want to attack that?;neutral
I believe we could defend ourselves against any foreign invader.;negative
By itself, the US probably could not defend against this attack.;negative
But how about 160 million soldiers?;neutral
The citizens of the United States can.;positive
With that number, we also have the ability to take over a tyrannical US government if the need should arise (though I hope it doesn't).;negative
I believe we can defend against any foreign power.;negative
Or like if aliens invaded.;neutral
Or like if the mole people came to the surface.;neutral
Or like if the computers became conscious and rebelled against their human masters.;neutral
Forgive the sarcasm but,;neutral
What are we talking about here?;neutral
1.;neutral
Our government is made up of citizens.;positive
It cannot become tyrannical unless a majority of its citizens allow it to, in which case it is about 79 million armed citizens against about 79 million armed citizens and the U.S. military.;negative
In which case armed citizens just means more dead citizens.;negative
2.;neutral
Okay, maybe all of these nations combined could defeat the U.S. I kind of doubt it though at this time in history.;negative
Most countries depend on us for their military and we could cut off funding.;negative
Even if not, our fire power is borderline comical compared to the rest of the world... combined.;negative
But, I doubt that if somehow these countries could and would want to invade the U.S. (ignoring there's nothing in it for them but a ruined world economy) if they could defeat all of the nuclear submarines, battleships, drones, fighter jets, etc etc etc, if they could do that, a bunch of citizens with guns isn't going to be much good.;negative
Just carpet bomb the states and then arm several billion Chinese to hunt the survivors down.;negative
The whole line of thought is outlandish though.;negative
Meanwhile high capacity clips and semi-automatic weapons, along with a lack of resources to identify and treat the mentally ill, is leading to way, way more deaths than are necessary.;negative
It cannot become tyrannical unless a majority of citizens allow it to;negative
History shows that this is not true.;negative
For example:;neutral
The October revolution was done by a small minority that took the advantage.;neutral
The majority of the population did not support the communists.;negative
Later, Stalin killed well over 15 million of his own people, who were banned from owning firearms.;negative
Ancient Rome is a classic example.;positive
When the Republic was dissolved, Emperors took over.;negative
They used their armies without public consent to take over.;neutral
Franco's Spain was taken over by an army coup from Morrocco.;negative
The majority held with the Republicans, but they didn't have the same military power as Franco's forces.;neutral
Franco then put down local insurrections and abused the minorities like the Catalonians and the Basques, who were not allowed to have firearms.;negative
You also have the problem of having the majority take overs that then abuse or murder their rivals.;negative
For example:;neutral
Nazi Germany.;neutral
That was a majority led takeover.;neutral
"The government banned the ""un-pure"" of having firearms.";neutral
That led to the easy disposal of the Jews.;neutral
Now you have Jews for the Preservation of Firearms.;neutral
Also, why are semi-auto weapons and expanded magazines (not clips, that is a whole other argument) the problem?;negative
That's like blaming a spoon for making someone fat.;negative
It is a tool.;neutral
People choose to do what they want with that tool.;neutral
The majority that own this are law-abiding citizens, while the very small minority of criminals give it a bad name.;negative
It's like the punishing whole class by not going to recess because one person was being mean.;neutral
The teacher would just punish that one kid, not the whole class!;negative
I feel like I'm a criminal when I am blamed because I have a gun just like the shooter's, yet they punish me for owning mine and not killing anyone with it.;negative
That is illogical.;negative
None of your examples were helped or could have been helped in the least, even a little, by giving one group or another more guns, first of all.;negative
Next, yes, semi-automatics and clips are part of the problem, because if people can't get them then less people die.;negative
Really.;neutral
You gun nuts use the same broken arguments over and over.;negative
"""Well it wouldn't save everyone so don't do anything"" or ""uh spoon for fat... and uh what did the NRA tell me again.""";negative
Okay, some people might or might not get their hands on an illegal semi-automatic weapon with 30 clips.;negative
But that crazy kid who just shot up that school wouldn't have.;neutral
If his mom didn't have an arsenal he might of had a shotgun or handgun, and only killed 2 or 3 kids before killing himself.;negative
That's the point.;neutral
Smart regulation along with efforts to identify mental illness will save real actual people, lots of them, every year.;positive
But no, you're more concerned about shadow governments, your too filled with fear of god knows what, so you won't listen to reason.;negative
"You gun nuts are so out of touch and fucking religious about your dumb weapons, it makes everyone else say, ""fuck these gun nuts then, they aren't dealing with reality.""";negative
So it's his mom's fault for being killed and him stealing her weapons?;negative
Let me give you an example.;positive
Columbine.;neutral
The man walked in with a weapon, during the middle of the Brady Bill.;negative
According to her bill, he shouldn't have been able to do that.;negative
But he did.;neutral
He killed many people because he had over 20 clips and magazines with him.;negative
"A criminal isn't just going to say ""I can bring only one clip"".";negative
If he can't bring one with more than 10 rounds, he will just bring more.;positive
Now I totally agree with the mental illness problem, that needs to be an issue, but not regulation.;negative
If we can reduce the number of mental people out there, than why wouldthey want to go out and kill people?;negative
Fix the problem, not the tool he misuses.;negative
Yeah in part.;neutral
It is the mom's fault for having guns lying around her psycho son could get a hold of.;negative
Which is why background checks should include whether you have crazy people living with you.;negative
If I have a crazy teen to young adult living with me, I sure as fuck make sure there is no way they can get their hands on a gun.;negative
I have no idea what she was thinking.;negative
Denial about her sons illness, maybe she thought she could get all Dirty Harry if he went nuts, but whatever she was thinking she was wrong.;negative
And it is very possible that this tragedy did not have to be as bad as it was if there were something in place to limit her firepower or make sure her son could not get a hold of those guns.;negative
And you can't catch everyone, people fall through the cracks.;negative
The point is that less people will die with better regulation.;negative
That some will still die is inevitable, but less people dying is a good thing.;negative
And you can still have a gun, you can still hunt, if you're scared of government or whatever you can still be armed.;positive
There is nothing wrong with a balanced approach and trying to fix an obvious problem though.;negative
I want to take a balanced approach, but the problem I run into are people who are too radical.;negative
I think that regulation in some areas may work, like better back-ground checks, but I don't think taking these away will work.;negative
The government did a study during the old Brady Bill and found out that crime in general DID go down, but violent crime with guns went up as well as school shootings.;negative
I don't want that to repeat.;negative
I think what contributed to it were the gun free zones.;neutral
I think that arming teachers who are willing could prevent shootings.;neutral
The only thing gun free zones do is disarm the teachers.;negative
In high school and elementary schools, students can't carry arms because they are too young, but teachers can.;negative
I think if they want to, they should be able to carry and protect against criminals who will just ignore the gun free zone anyway.;neutral
"""I think that arming teachers who are willing could prevent shootings.""";neutral
We would have to train our teachers like Police Officers or Military personnel for this to be feasible.;negative
We’d have to pay for that training and there would need to be refresher courses and re-licensing periodically.;negative
If we didn't require training, the increased presence of firearms on school property would add to tensions between hormone-addled teenagers and teachers at their wit's end.;negative
Eventually, a disturbed student WILL bring a firearm to school.;negative
In the initial panic that would inevitably ensue, the potential for friendly-fire shootings would be significant.;negative
Yes, there would be a chance for someone to disable or kill the aggressor, but would more bullets be the best thing for that situation?;negative
"Let’s assume for a moment that the original gunman was taken down fairly quickly; there still remains the likelihood that the confusion and panic following such an event would create subsequent dangers.";negative
If an armed person is wounded or killed, a panicked student would be able to gain possession of a firearm and have the potential to make a bad situation much, much worse.;negative
If the student began firing the weapon, they might then be mistaken for an accomplice when in reality, they are terrified and fighting for their life.;negative
"To arm the public as you seem to wish to, we would need gun laws much like Switzerland; the Swiss have no standing army, but the majority of males between the ages of 20-30 are conscripted into the militia and undergo military training, including weapons training.";negative
If such laws were enacted, I doubt very much Americans would see this as a boon to freedom.;negative
If you have a trained teacher, then the worry about friendly fire is negligible.;negative
You don't need to train a teacher like the police or military.;negative
Every concealed carry holder is trained to know what is behind their target, and not to go in guns blazing like Rambo.;negative
1 to the head 2 to the chest, or a dedicated pair to the chest reduces the risk of friendly fire as well as taking the assailant down.;negative
Now, the problem of a student taking a firearm and being mistaken and shot is hard to imagine.;negative
Every student, including I, is taught to hide in the corner of the classroom.;negative
The teacher would then face the door with their weapon and if the shooter comes through, there is no risk to the students of being shot unless the shooter kills the teacher.;negative
If the teacher takes down the assailant, they have control of the situation and can take control of the shooter's weapon.;negative
A student isn't going to rush to the weapon and take it.;negative
As for training the teachers, a lot of schools, gun schools, and other organizations have offered to teach teachers for free.;negative
And if we offer the training to teachers voluntarily, then the teacher may pay for it themselves or the school might do it for them.;negative
Re-licensing is cheap.;negative
Now, a teacher who is at their wit's end probably shouldn't have a firearm in the first place.;neutral
That's when records and back-ground checks will come in.;neutral
They will probably be more stringent than usual due to the situation, so they will be more effective.;negative
Now the chance of an angry student trying to take a weapon would also be negligible.;negative
The teacher won't be carrying it on their person at all times.;negative
Most teachers that are allowed weapons keep them in a handgun safe, or in a central school safe.;negative
Friendly fire is always a concern where live ammunition is being discharged.;negative
And, I don’t know how you feel, but I would not let my child attend a school staffed by teachers who only possessed concealed-carry permits.;negative
Common sense would dictate that going in “like Rambo” is a horrible idea, but there’s no way to predict how someone might react under live-fire.;negative
A seasoned gun-man with years of experience could still have his judgment impaired when his life is in danger.;positive
"I understand that you’re taught to hide in the corner; I was as well.";positive
"However, you cannot predict how certain individuals will react; this is a recurring flaw in your argument.";negative
Allowing teachers to carry weapons on school property allows for countless scenarios in which they are disabled, their weapon is lost, and a frightened individual could gain possession of that weapon.;negative
"The rest of your argument relies on the survival of faculty; something that cannot be guaranteed.";negative
As soon as one faculty member is killed, students in that classroom would most probably try and flee or gain control of a weapon.;negative
The only other option would be to face almost certain death at the barrel of the aggressor’s gun.;negative
This idealized scenario has little chance of fulfilling itself in reality.;negative
As you said, a teacher at their wits end shouldn’t have a fire arm.;negative
But, the career of teaching is one that inherently has a great amount of stress that comes with it.;positive
A teacher with a clean back-ground check could actually have a mild emotional disturbance that is aggravated by the stress of being a teacher.;negative
The only measure that could be taken to combat this would be to require teachers to submit to compulsory psychiatric evaluations periodically, and that still leaves the possibility for someone to falsely represent their mental state.;negative
The risk of allowing teachers to carry arms far outweighs any benefits.;neutral
I agree, friendly fire is always a concern.;positive
However, I still think that allowing the teacher to arm themselves is a better option than not letting them, and putting a sign in from staying no guns allowed which the shooter has never followed anyway.;neutral
I also think that many people who own weapons have even more high-stress jobs than a teacher could.;negative
Private Security, Police, and construction are high stress environments.;neutral
Now, I know you would say that the Private Security and Police have training.;negative
What I'm saying is the training given to teachers would make them just as capable handling a firearm as a police officer.;negative
Police even encourage training for concealed carry.;positive
They approve.;neutral
And if a Faculty member is killed, then it is the same situation if the faculty member had no firearm at all.;negative
If a faculty memeber dies, then another must contain the situation, or a student may be able to also.;negative
I know there are a lot of risks, but there are risks for almost everything we do in life.;neutral
I say arming teacher benefits outweigh the risk.;neutral
I agree that criminals aren't going to follow the law, however we shouldn't make it easier for them to access weapons.;negative
"Earlier I stated that teachers should be trained as if they were police-officers; you've almost agreed with me on that point.";negative
"I would not want a teacher to be trained to the same level as average citizens; I would want them to be more capable with that responsibility.";negative
"Simply possessing a concealed carry permit doesn't make someone a master-gunman; it takes an emotional fortitude and clarity of mind to assess and react to dangerous situations involving live fire.";positive
How is a faculty member is killed and not having a fire-arm in the first place equitable in any way?;neutral
If they had no fire-arm, and were killed, there would not be another fire-arm for the aggressor to use or for another student to obtain.;negative
"""If a faculty memeber dies, then another must contain the situation, or a student may be able to also.""";negative
"And now, you've condoned students trying to ""contain"" a situation that will very probably get them killed.";negative
You may say the benefits outweigh the risk, but careful investigation would prove otherwise.;negative
Now, the way most average citizens are trained is very good.;positive
To be able to have a concealed carry permit, you must pass a test done by the Police department.;negative
I think if the Police approve, the carrier is well trained.;neutral
A teacher receiving the same training would be very good, and would be able to defend themselves and their students.;negative
Now, I did say that a student may be able to control the situation.;neutral
If he is being faced down by the shooter, any way the student can defend themself is justified, including picking up the weapon and firing back.;negative
What I disputed was that students who gained a weapon who were scared and over reacting would be a danger by running around and shooting.;negative
They absolutely can, but I don't see it happening.;negative
The way a school is controlled during a lockdown would prevent this from happening.;negative
Your argument about not arming teachers because if the teacher is killed there is no weapon for the shooter to use is, I think, I little absurd.;negative
The shooter came prepared.;neutral
Either way he is going to shoot and kill people.;negative
If a teacher is killed without a weapon, then the shooter just keeps going.;negative
If a teacher is killed that was armed, the shooter may pick it up.;negative
But either way he is still going to kill.;neutral
I would rather have the opportunity of a good guy, be that a student or another teacher, to be able to pick up that gun and kill the assailant than letting the shooter just keep going.;negative
"There are non-lethal ways to control the situation; anything else is unnecessary.";negative
Why should we go non-lethal when the criminal will not give the same courtesy?;negative
"So he can stand trial like any other American citizen; death does not restore life.";negative
Your blood-lust-attitude is the very reason we HAVE a justice system.;neutral
A PERSON with a gun may take a life, but they can preserve it too.;positive
I just wish you could see that.;negative
"I can see that; you can't see that guns are tools made for killing.";positive
A person with a gun who stops an aggressor will likely kill that person, where there were viable non-lethal options.;negative
incapacitation, not termination, should be the goal.;negative
Yes, we should have the right to carry firearms.;positive
The criminals will carry them even if it is illegal to carry them.;positive
The world will always have a black-market for weapons.;positive
The United States is the only large, successful national power that allows this - it's in our bill of rights.;negative
It needs to stay.;neutral
The price of such a right is this: less crime over-all, more fatal crimes, and of course, more fatal accidents.;negative
Yet, I don't want to live in a police state where ONLY the police and the army have weapons.;negative
I will say this: people who own or carry guns need to be stable, mature, rational people.;neutral
Of course, there is a lot of power in those who would be deciding WHO is psychologically sound enough to own and carry a weapon.;positive
Just know that the police have just as many accidents with weapons as the general public.;negative
I disagree that guns protect US citizens from a police state.;negative
The US has the most powerful military in the world, and privately owned guns will not be able to stop it.;positive
While Saddam Hussein was in power in Iraq, guns were virtually unregulated.;negative
The Iraqi regime had a much less powerful military than the US, and the citizens still didn't use their guns to give themselves freedom.;negative
Another example is Iran.;neutral
There is an extremely oppressive government without much popular support, and many people own guns, yet the Iranian government is extremely stable.;negative
Yes, in a world were universal and common threats exist for people, they should have the right to defend themselves from those threats.;positive
Because its impossible to remove all the guns from the world, and passing laws restricting guns will only be followed by law abiding citizens.;negative
It's illogical to only disarm the citizens.;negative
(Which is basically all that law is capable of doing);negative
That's basically leaving the teeth in the mouth of the wolves and turning men into sheep.;neutral
No, but I'd support the right to carry swords.;negative
The thing is, you can shoot someone and be hidden in a building, metres away from them.;negative
Swords/daggers offer protection too, but they aren't cowardly.;negative
I can go to time square , hide a sword in my jacket, and then in a large crowd slice people's neck.;negative
That is a very painful way to die;negative
Swords are much more difficult to hide though, and you are at a greater risk of beeing caught or harmed, and they are easier to defend from.;negative
So if you were to go completely insane, yet could only find a sword instead of a semi-automatic with 30+ clips, you'd go to time square and kill, what?;negative
3, 4 people if you're like a samurai?;neutral
5 or 6 if you're a ninja?;neutral
Meanwhile in this Universe where you can go completely insane and get that semi-automatic, you'd go to time square and kill, what 10-15 people if you're half blind and have a bad knee?;negative
20-30 people if you've ever seen anyone shoot a gun ever in your life?;neutral
40-50 people if you've actually practiced with that gun?;neutral
Fucking great!;positive
Where do I sign up for the first one?;neutral
I don't think so.;neutral
"I'd rather live in a society where one person can't ""look at another person and press a button"" and have that second person die.";negative
It's too much power for one person to have.;negative
Already in America you have to assume that every person around you packing heat and at any time could end your life (without you even knowing) at any time for any reason (their crazy, they don't like your shoes, you bump their car in a parking lot, you disagree with them on X, etc..);negative
.;neutral
"Can't imagine anyone ""designing"" a civil society would want such a situation to be possible.";negative
Yes, I know someone could still stab you, etc, but they have to be next to you, get bloody and you have good chance of surviving.;negative
Also, knives have specific utility in the society (very high utility I might add) besides killing things.;negative
Your argument is presented as a preference of how you would rather live, and that preference is based on fallacious logic that if a person can use something to kill you easily, no one should be allowed to have it.;negative
So following your logic, we should not be allowed to have cars either, because at any moment, some one can drive on to a sidewalk and run you over.;negative
It's true that other things in society can kill you but there are differences.;neutral
A car has huge utility outside of running people over.;positive
This makes it impractical to even be considered as something to get rid of, so I don't.;negative
"While it's true that at any moment a random person could run you over, maybe resulting in death, that's just ""bad luck"".";negative
They could have chosen anyone, they chose me.;negative
"However, the case I don't like is where for example I fire a bad employee and they decide to use their ""kill button"" to ""settle the score"".";neutral
They could try and run me over but that is much much harder because, I have to be walking someplace that A car can easily reach, where I won't notice the car coming, etc.;negative
The ease of being able to kill a specific person (or a group of people) with a gun is much higher than with a car.;positive
Your logic is still fallacious.;neutral
If you remove all the guns in the world, then a person intent on murder would just use the next easiest thing to do it with.;negative
Although the point is mute, because its impossible to remove all the guns in the world, we can still look at our past, when guns didn't exist yet, and people still went to war and murdered.;negative
It's also silly to say that guns don't serve a purpose.;neutral
They provide food for some people still to this day and they provide protection for others.;neutral
My mother was kidnapped when I was two and barely escaped with her life, she now legally carries a pistol at all times, as do I.;positive
So again, lets show the fallacy of your logic, you now say a car is different because its harder to kill someone with it.;negative
Ok, well a knife is a universal tool needed for cutting and cooking, but yet it can be used to kill.;positive
It can actually be just as easy to kill, maybe even easier, because its quieter and easier to get than a gun.;negative
Should we ban all knives too?;negative
A privilege maybe, but not a right unless you are part of a trained militia.;negative
Why are things essential for functioning in modern society, like a car, a privilege, while something utterly unnecessary is considered a right?;negative
It's dumb.;negative
The 2nd amendment doesn't say you have to be in a militia to keep and bear Arms.;negative
Being able to defend yourself against an attacker with a gun isn't utterly unnecessary.;negative
The two most common arguments seem to be that firearms protect us from an oppressive government, and that people who want to will find a way to murder whether or not guns are legal.;negative
I will address both of these points separately.;positive
First, firearms do not protect against a tyrannical government.;neutral
The US makes up 40% of the international military spending.;negative
Privately owned guns are not going to stop it if it wants to take away rights.;negative
Also, there is no historical precedent of firearms creating more freedom.;negative
The US is the only developed country without strict gun laws.;negative
European countries are just as free, if not more free than the US.;negative
Second, people who really want to murder somebody aren't going to be stopped, whether or not other people have guns.;neutral
After some research, I can't find any solid examples of armed civilians stopping a shooter.;negative
There are possible examples, but I believe that most of them are too unclear to accurately determine whether the shooters would have killed more people.;negative
Also, murderers will find a way to kill people.;negative
Armed civilians won't stop them.;negative
I believe that people who spend time planning a murder will also plan how not to be shot while doing it.;negative
Finally, banning guns will stop the unplanned, spur-of-the-moment killlings.;negative
The people who are mad and pick up a gun to shoot someone won't be able to kill.;negative
The people who wake up and decide to rob a gas station won't be able to kill.;negative
Another common pro-gun point is the Swiss and Israeli models of gun control.;negative
The common idea of Israel having extremely deregulated guns is an outright lie.;negative
Switzerland is more complicated, though.;positive
Every citizen has a gun, but they are not privately owned guns in the same way American guns are.;negative
Every Swiss who is able to work in the military is required to, and during their service, they get a single unloaded gun to keep at their house.;positive
The lack of mass shootings in Israel is the result of a crackdown on terrorism, and I'm not sure what causes a decreased number of shootings in Europe, but it is likely a mix between guns being less available and a culture that does more to deter shootings.;negative
If you couldn't find any, here are some:;neutral
Pearl High School, Oct. 1st, 1997;negative
Luke Woodham goes into the school and kills two students and injures several others.;negative
The principal retrieves a .45 pistol from his truck and confronts Luke.;negative
Luke runs to his car to escape but is prevented by the principal, who holds Luke until police arrive.;negative
"In 2010, a man entered an AT&T;store in New York and started firing.";negative
A customer with a concealed carry drew their .40 revolver and shot and killed the shooter.;negative
At the Clackamas mall in Portland, Oregon.;neutral
A shooter with a rifle walks into the mall and opens fire and kills 2 people.;negative
A man with a concealed carry permit draws his weapon and confronts the shooter.;positive
When the shooter sees him, he turns the weapon on himself and commits suicide.;neutral
There are plenty more, you just need to look.;negative
I would like to address your points and offer my counter-points.;neutral
1.;neutral
The US may have the best military, but that still does not give them the right to ban guns.;neutral
If we rebelled because they did, they wouldn't be able to wipe is out.;negative
For a modern example, look at Syria and Libya.;positive
Both governments had jets, bombs, rockets, tanks, and more weapons than the citizens did.;negative
However, the Libyans won their war and the Syrians have the capital surrounded.;neutral
Both governments have lost, to citizens with firearms.;negative
They can get rid of a tyrannical government.;negative
2.;neutral
Now, if guns are banned, they will still be used in crimes.;neutral
Look at Britain, where it is illegal to carry a firearm, yet they are still used in crime.;negative
According to the law, the criminal shouldn't have one.;negative
But criminals don't follow laws.;negative
Also, the point you made on prevented mass shootings as not very good examples because it was not proved that the shooter might have killed more is wrong.;negative
The shooter didn't kill more because he was prevented!;negative
How can someone judge that he was going to kill more if he doesn't state so or is captured?;neutral
He was either killed before he could murder more or was held by an armed citizen.;negative
The criminal can still buy a weapon if so chooses.;negative
However, he now has to buy it illegally, while the law-abiding citizen can't own one anymore.;neutral
You now have a haven for the criminal.;neutral
people must not be given the right to carry fire arms because some people are irresponsible and can misuse it.;negative
You will walk around with the fear that your life might end at any time.;negative
at the moment people are reckless with things like cars and booze what more if you give them the right to carry firearms which are easy to use and dangerous;negative
No one should be carrying firearms.;negative
Firearms are dangerous and no good is going to come out of them.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
It doesn't matter what tyrannical government that we defend against;neutral
Which government are you going to defend against which the U.S. government cannot defend against.;negative
A privilege maybe, but not a right unless you are part of a trained militia.;negative
Why are things essential for functioning in modern society, like a car, a privilege, while something utterly unnecessary is considered a right?;negative
"Becuase the United States has, in my humble opinion, lost many of its absolutes, there are alot of twisted ""laws"" and ""rights"" that only pull the country down.";negative
"One ""right"" in particular is the ""Right to Bear Arms"".";positive
Personally I think its just stupid to allow civillians to carry weapons, because that's just asking for some angry person to go postal.;negative
From the many school shootings to domestic violience that have plauged the U.S of A in recent years, I think its time to face the facts: giving civillians weapons is a stupid idea.;negative
"Sure the people want to defend themselves, but giving them guns only fuels more need to ""defend"".";negative
"What I am saying is that the ""Right to Bear Arms"" should not be a right and the ""defending"" should be left to the professionals (police, military, etc.).";negative
Sure, America is obsessed with right to bear arms, what does that really mean anyway?;negative
Does it mean that I have the right to own nuclear weapons or a gun?;negative
Well, the government thinks no and yes.;neutral
If Congress overturned the 2nd Amendment, there would be mass chaos and anarchy.;negative
No it isn't.;negative
It was meant for the purpose of local malitias.;neutral
But we have those now, they're called cops and National Guard.;neutral
They didn't have those in abundance back then.;negative
They also used muskets back then, not semi-automatics that can kill literally dozens of people in seconds.;negative
So the times have changed.;neutral
Gun proponents are completely brain washed.;negative
They've let the NRA convince them they are safer if they carry a gun.;neutral
That's ridiculous.;negative
More people die in accidental shootings than in purposeful ones.;negative
"As for ""well criminals will still get guns.""";positive
That's a logical fallacy when applied to whether they should be legal to get.;neutral
1.;neutral
You're not dirty harry, and if a blood or crip or some deranged killer wants your life they'll take it before you can draw your six shooter cowboy.;negative
2.;neutral
Instead of making them legal for everyone who thinks they are quick draw McGraw, fine gun companies when it is found that their gun was used in a crime.;neutral
Mess with their bottom line and you would be amazed how quickly criminals won't be able to magically get guns anymore.;negative
All of that said, I have no problem with Pobunk Missouri pop.;negative
3000 allowing citizens to have hunting rifles.;neutral
However, the people of Pobunk Missouri (and the NRA) should not be allowed to say that every gangbanger in S. Chicago should be allowed to pick up a gun at the corner store simply because in the 1700's the founders weren't fortune tellers and didn't know how far the technology would go with firearms.;neutral
I love how gun sellers have convinced people that live somewhere else entirely that they need to get all crazy when the majority in a different area says they want guns to be illegal.;neutral
You guys are suckers.;negative
The right to bear arms declared by the seccond amendment is not what you think.;negative
It actualy reffers to the old militia of the states right to bear arms in a civilian atmosphere.;negative
When the government declared the civilian right to bear arms thought of today, crime rates drop little more than 2%, but in a matter of years, crime rates increased by almost 8%, worse off than before.;negative
It is now 2015 and the gun violence in America continues to get worse.;negative
Aww, Democrat.;positive
Can't use facts so you just make stuff up?;negative
No wonder Democrat is in your name.;negative
Gun violence is not getting worse.;negative
C:UsersKylePicturesimagesCAR6FZY0.jpg;neutral
The picture you posted isn't showing.;negative
On to the point though.;neutral
I'm against gun control.;negative
People since the beginning of time have killed people.;neutral
It will continue too.;positive
People can kill others by their bare hands.;neutral
Why ban guns when it won't solve the problem.;negative
Besides, the criminals always gets guns, illegaly or legaly.;negative
It doesn't matter.;neutral
Murder will always exsit.;neutral
ya i saw that weard but on your argument you are totaly right murder predates firearms;neutral
Spoken like a true Emo.;positive
"But yes, people can kill other people with their bare hands... but, the catch is; IT TAKES LONGER.";negative
Definitely long enough for some retard cop to come rolling down and save the day!;negative
Oh, and also, you could fight back, long enough to protect YO SELF.;neutral
But it's kinda different with a gun.;positive
You couldn't just hold off the attack, because the bullet would of already pimp slapped you back to Mumbai.;negative
Also, the one holding the damn gun can kill, kill, kill almost instantaneously.;negative
You've heard of those school shootings right?;neutral
Things would of been much better if the filicidal serial killer just had fists to bludgeon the damn kids, but the Gym teacher would of already sodomized him with a dodge ball.;negative
It is true that murder exists, but hemorrhoids exist too, and do you know what we do to hemorrhoids?;negative
WE PUT CREAM ON THEM TO MAKE THEM BETTER, and so the irritation wouldn't be as bad.;negative
It's what we should do to murder!;neutral
We could remove all the guns, so the murder wouldn't be as bad.;negative
Of course, removing guns won't solve the problem, but it would make it a hell of a lot better than it is!;negative
That is far from the truth.;neutral
Gun bans have only correlated with a higher murder rate.;negative
And removal of laws restricting your right to carry a firearm in public have correlated with lower murder rates.;negative
This doesn't prove that gun bans or gun control are causing this, but it surely shows that gun bans and gun control aren't fixing anything.;negative
(Notice that there is a control using the data nation wide so it wasn't a phenomena around the country).;negative
I'm a emo?;neutral
Clearly, you didn't read your comment.;negative
I'm a realist.;neutral
I tell you like it is from my point of view.;positive
The truth is that you just crushed your own post.;negative
You agreed that gun control would continue people killing each other but you said it would take longer.;neutral
I would rather die quicker then with a knife stuck in my gullet.;negative
Due to your lack of common sense, I didn't get past the first paragraph before I peed all over myself from laughter.;negative
Therefore, if I were you, I wouldn't dispute this post and make yourself look like an idiot.;negative
Stupid can't be cured.;negative
"I'm saying you are an emo, because you are practically saying ""We shouldn't ban guns because people die from fists anyway.""";negative
I mean, how dumb is that?;negative
That is clearly emo!;positive
But what you don't understand is that GUNS are FAR range, and can be fired RAPIDLY.;positive
I can't believe you would find humor in my argument.;negative
Never did I ever say that.;negative
I'm saying people have killed each other since the beginning of time.;neutral
How dumb are you?;negative
You are pulling things out of your ass.;neutral
"Let me give you an idea of what an ""emo"" is.";positive
An emo is someone who is in a emotional disorder state.;negative
"""Emos"", are usually seen as depressed and on the verge of suicide.";negative
Therefore, most of them have signs showing they are about to commit suicide like cutting themselves, wanting to be isolated, angry or irritated, etc..;negative
.;neutral
"Throughout your previous comment, you stated, ""But yes, people can kill other people with their bare hands... but, the catch is; IT TAKES LONGER"".";negative
I said that I would rather die quickly then dieing slowly.;negative
YOU are the one sounding like an emo every time I read your posts.;negative
Depends.;neutral
A handgun is good for a hundred yards or so.;positive
Shooting further then that and expecting to hit your target is almost impossible.;neutral
Now if you are talking about a hunting rifle, they can reach for hundreds of yards depending on what type of rifle it is.;negative
Most crime is done with a handgun from point blank range.;negative
Oh, I didn't find the argument to be funny at all.;negative
I'm laughing at your ignorance.;positive
I don't see how the fact that people have been killing in the past have anything to do with not banning gun control...;negative
I mean you seem emo.;neutral
You have this hopeless attitude towards death.;negative
I sounded the OPPOSITE to Emo.;negative
What you have said sounded emo... about dying quickly.;neutral
Didn't you know that when someone punches you, you don't have to lie down and take it until you die?;negative
You could actually get up and start defending yourself- with other people around that could help- without fear as no firearm was involved.;negative
If this circumstance occurred where firearms were not included, MORE lives would be saved!;negative
So... definitely kills better than fists... not to mention rapid fire...;negative
We would be literally saving LIVES if we reduced firearm access!;negative
I'm not the ignorant one here... I'm actually the one who wants to save lives...;negative
It doesn't.;negative
You keep on saying it does.;neutral
Therefore, I counter that.;negative
First of all, you can't tell who a person is by just reading their comments.;negative
Secondly, I do not have a hopless attitude towards death.;negative
Death is a terrible thing and I wish there was no such thing.;negative
However, we have it.;neutral
So we have to deal with it.;neutral
So I believe you would rather die slowly?;negative
I don't know anyone that would.;negative
Yes, I wish everyone would man up and fight with fists.;negative
I knew a few people that got beaten to death though.;negative
Sad that they have to live through that until they died.;negative
Firearms will always exist, in the wrong and/or right hands.;negative
Alright, I meant to say this in my first post.;neutral
Criminals will always have guns.;positive
Leagally or illegally.;neutral
Yes, it will make it harder to get guns, but when they have them who is going to stop them?;neutral
Yes, the police will come, but they will be taking a picture of your dead body when they do.;neutral
"On the ""rapid fire"" part.";positive
In the US, it's illegal to have a automatic weapon without a permit of some sort.;negative
Handguns legal in the US can only shoot as fast as you pull the trigger.;negative
Have your ever shot a gun really fast?;neutral
It's really hard to keep it on target.;negative
Actually, statistics shows that a well armed community has low crime rates.;negative
Trust me, if I were a criminal, I would think twice before going into their homes knowing they might have a gun.;negative
Let me tell you a true story.;positive
My Grandpa was fishing one night on the lake.;neutral
He always loved to fish.;positive
One night, he was checking his lines when a couple of men approached him.;negative
They were trying to talk to him as they were walking up.;neutral
Soon, one of them got too close and he told them to leave and find another fishing hole.;negative
They didn't.;neutral
One man picked up a rock and walked up behind him.;positive
My grandpa heard him and turned around with a 12 guage.;neutral
The man frozed.;neutral
The man has a rock and was about to bust my grandpa across the head.;neutral
This isn't uncommon.;negative
Many people have been knocked cold, mugged, and their bodys thrown into the river.;negative
"After a long silence, the man spoke up and said, ""he has a gun"".";negative
The men backed off, got into their truck, and droved off.;positive
If my grandpa didn't have that gun, he wouldn't be here today.;negative
It might seem you want to save people's lives.;negative
But you don't think what would happen if gun control was in place.;neutral
Here in the U.S., we are allowed to be armed under the second amendment.;negative
We are armed for one reason.;neutral
To keep the goverment at bay.;neutral
Thats what our founding fathers said.;neutral
To keep the goverment at bay.;neutral
Look down history where guns have been abolished.;negative
Usually, a massacare happens or the goverment becomes so strong that the people have no say.;negative
There is a whole bigger picture then what we have been discussing.;positive
I said you seem like an emo.;negative
Here's a quote from your previous argument: I'm against gun control.;negative
People since the beginning of time have killed people.;neutral
It will continue too.;positive
People can kill others by their bare hands.;neutral
Why ban guns when it won't solve the problem.;negative
How hopeless is that?!;negative
You are against the removal of a highly efficient murder-weapon, purely because people from the past can kill people, and punching up people seems to be worse than a gun shot wound, and instant death.;negative
Fists are avoidable.;neutral
You could run at any time... the same doesn't apply to guns.;negative
Also, gun wounds, hurt like hell.;negative
Worse.;neutral
And I'd better have my chances in hospital with punch-wounds instead of bullet wounds.;negative
I've known a person who was shot in the stomach, along with thousands of stories about gangs, and driveby shooting.;neutral
Have you not even considered the school shootings?;negative
Without access to their parent's firearms MANY people would of lived to this day.;negative
Being beaten up takes a while you know... and you'd get over it in hospital to recover and live your life.;neutral
Do not compare guns to fists... the wars between guns and melee weapons (Native indian against guns) ALWAYS ended with the death of the side that had no guns.;negative
You are brazenly incorrect.;negative
When people/security come, they will run and separate the two.;neutral
With guns, it would be more of police taking pictures of your dead body.;negative
Have you not seen the random punch ons that end with the security separating them appart?;negative
Have you not seen that when guns are involved, it turns into a full hostage situation?;negative
Care to show me those statistics?;neutral
In Australia (where guns are illegal) we seem to have a considerably lower murder rate than all the gun wielding countries.;negative
And about the anecdote of your grandfather, those situations do not happen as virulently as school shootings and town massacres.;negative
Your grandpa may have survived but the hundreds of children who were shot dead in the multiple school shootings that occurred due to access of firearms, and the hostage situations involving guns could of been stopped, had guns not been easy to obtain.;negative
As said before, you can't judge me when you don't even know me.;negative
Get off the emo crap.;negative
It is sad, but it's the truth.;neutral
You cannot deny that.;negative
A gun is not a murder weapon.;negative
It is also used in hunting and shooting competitions.;negative
"However, since you want to elaborate on a ""murder weapon"", as said before, criminals will ALWAYS get their hands on a weapon or gun somehow.";neutral
Gun control isn't going to solve anything.;negative
Have you ever seen someone get jumped?;neutral
It happens so fast you don't have time to react.;negative
Usually, it is with a group of people too.;negative
As said before, criminals will always get weapons.;negative
Gun wounds do hurt like hell.;negative
But if someone was going to pick a fight with me, I'm going to tell them straight up.;negative
If they continue with that I'm going to take every right ot defend myself.;positive
It's not what you think.;negative
Here in the US no one just walks up and shoots the other guy.;neutral
It happens for a reason.;neutral
Just like a fight happens for a reason.;neutral
It's not at random.;negative
Here in the US it has changed.;neutral
Most big schools that occurs in now requires you to go through security checks.;negative
Most schools now have a lot of police officers with tasers and sometimes lethal weapons.;neutral
These school shooting could easily been stop by this.;negative
Sadly, the didn't react fast enough.;negative
Not when you die from it.;negative
Thats were I'm getting at.;neutral
Thats another thing I touched on.;positive
As said a hundred times, criminals will always gets guns.;positive
Taking away weapons from law abiding citizens will only get them killed in the end.;negative
Gun control solves nothing.;negative
And why are you bringing up war?;negative
Military will not follow gun control.;negative
When someone bursts into your house they WILL kill you.;negative
What are you talking about?;neutral
Read the comment again.;negative
It seems like you skipped over most of my post.;negative
Re read it.;neutral
Sure, why not.;negative
However, this site will destroy what you have said.;neutral
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1083303/posts;neutral
Mugging happens ALL THE TIME!;neutral
Massacares are done usually by a country that has gun control.;negative
Search some facts and get back to me if you would like to debate on the massacare thing.;negative
Even if I don't know you, your words give some kind of idea.;negative
"That's why I said ""Seem.""";negative
I'm not denying that.;negative
I'm saying it sounds hopeless because you all of a sudden believe that banning guns won't solve the problem- when it clearly could.;negative
If you were at war, in a world where guns didn't exist, only like 10 people would die instead of 10,000.;negative
Guns are like nuclear weapons compared to fists- that is undeniable.;neutral
A gun is a freaken murder weapon.;neutral
"Just because you could ""hunt deer"" and shoot in competitions doesn't invalidate the fact that you could also use it to kill people.";negative
Are you so blind as to ignore all the homicides in the news where people have been killed with guns?;negative
How dumb can someone be to decide to ignore the fact that guns could also quite rather be a highly efficient murder weapon compared to fists?;negative
You are shooting a poisonous, searing hunk of lead at a thousand miles an hour, straight into the vital organs of a human being, and then merely placing another magazine in to do it again to another person within a split second.;negative
Something no fist can match.;negative
Oh, so security guards don't exist now?;negative
So one punch means you're dead?;neutral
So when someone comes up to punch you, you would have much of a better chance of escape when the person has a gun because bullets are way slower and weaker than fists?;negative
Who would think that?;neutral
And concerning that matter about how criminals could get their guns anyway, removing the damn gun shops would sure as hell LESSEN the availability of guns for these criminals.;negative
Is that not good?;negative
Not everyone is you.;neutral
Mental disorders/ Anger problems exist.;negative
This is what drives serial killers most of the time.;negative
And not everyone is the same.;negative
Also, during conflicts, innocent people could be killed, like in gang wars, or hostage situations.;negative
Also, with the accessibility of ranged weapons on the market, armed robberies become more common, and more things have been efficiently stolen as everyone was too scared to be shot.;negative
And anyway, if you pissed off some guy either intentionally or unintentionally, wouldn't you prefer he express his anger by punching you up(at a point where someone could break it up), instead of placing a bullet in your head without any chance of retaliation?;negative
I don't know what rock you were living in but fatality rates with guns are way more higher than fists.;negative
But they wouldn't of been needed to spend money on this damn protection without the shockingly high accessibility of guns in your country.;negative
In my country, we don't need that because we hardly get any school shootings.;negative
"But what you need to understand is that there are multiple factors that make this irrelevant in real life; such as public or authoritative intervention, self defense, and evasion- none of which apply when guns are involved.";negative
As I have said before, removing the availability of guns would lessen the chance of armed criminals.;negative
They would have to work harder to obtain them, and have brains and Intel to access the black market.;negative
This would mean that potential serial killers, who aren't informed and wealthy enough to get access to the black market are canceled out, and no one would be murdered by them as much.;negative
See?;positive
It lessens things... don't you want those chances to be lessened?;negative
And I mentioned war do demonstrate the destruction of guns, compared to fists.;negative
When someone bursts into your house, when no one else is around, they will most likely kill you if they have a gun.;negative
If they just burst in with melee weapons, you could most likely escape, if you understand the chances.;negative
"And also, not all fist fights occur in homes; they also occur on the streets where people could intervene and stop them.";negative
This doesn't apply to guns, because people would be too scared to be shot.;negative
"The ""trusted"" statistics from your lonely, shady source is a little unspecific.";negative
It only shows accounts of violence- not concerning fatality.;negative
Unfortunately, alcohol abuse is a large problem in my country, so violent attacks would be common.;negative
But that's just culture, and in those multiple attacks, at least the victims involved survived in hospital straight after.;positive
But in America, fatality is high within the small percentage, due to weapon usage, as bullets tend to kill.;negative
But that fatality can be considerable lowered, so people could walk out of hospital alive.;positive
I find you hard to believe.;negative
Why in the hell would a country where mentally challenged criminals could buy their guns from a shop at any time have more violent shootings?;negative
How about you search up the facts.;neutral
I've read too much about school shootings to know that the people involved who shot the place bought their guns from the local gun shop.;neutral
The facts speak loudly that you are brazenly asserting nonsensical things.;negative
You go now and hug your guns.;positive
Any Federal gun regulation I am against.;negative
It makes little sense to give the Federal government the ability to regulate gun ownership to an individual level.;negative
I believe that it's okay for the States to require gun registrations.;neutral
I don't exactly believe that it's a must, but to me it's truly up to the States and local governments to decide for themselves.;negative
I would not demand that the Federal government goes the other way and restrict the ability for States to register gun ownership.;negative
However, I find any gun bans to be Unconstitutional and ineffective.;neutral
Disarmed People = Are Dominated People;neutral
Simple as that so do we really want to ban guns?;negative
I like the current system in England.;neutral
It means we have less people running around shooting eachother willy nilly.;neutral
Normally I am pro rights on most matters, but the thing about guns is that their one and only purpose is to kill shit.;negative
Yes, you can go clay pigeon shooting (which is fun), but that is just to simulate killing real pigeons, (which taste a lot better).;negative
It doesn't mean you can't own a gun, it just means you can't own a gun for the wrong reasons.;negative
It's quite clear that, if more people have guns that are allowed to be left lying around, more accidents will happen, and crimes of passion will be easier.;negative
Just check the gun crime rates of Britain against America.;neutral
America firearm related death rate: 10.27;neutral
England/Wales firearm related death rate: 0.46;negative
You can't argue with the numbers, gun control saves lives.;negative
"Well I'm not for complete control nor complete ban but making it harder for people to get a gun legally makes it harder for them to be sold illegally seeing as there wouldn't be as many guns to go ""missing"".";negative
I think something along the lines of a yearly check in or something with the police to prove you still have your gun would help stop people selling them when needing cash.;neutral
Guns are tools and in the right hands are used for fun as in target shooting or for food like hunting (I do not condone trophy hunting, if I kill something I will eat it and use all I can from it).;negative
Anyway, a full banning would make it harder to track guns because you will have a greater black market as well as those stupid enough to make their own ( which isn't that hard).;negative
My point is lets keep them but make them them harder to lose track of with more checking and better ideas of customer demand, why build more guns than they sell?;negative
As for military weapons, don't have so much trust in single people, better teams are the solution.;negative
Two or more people are harder to bribe or keep quite compared to one checker.;neutral
God I hope this doesn't sound to stupid, I can't give my reasons much better.;negative
I am for strict gun control.;neutral
The stricter the better.;positive
The gun violence in America has to end.;neutral
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
Of course, removing guns won't solve the problem, but it would make it a hell of a lot better than it is!;negative
I would rather die quicker then with a knife stuck in my gullet.;negative
"""We shouldn't ban guns because people die from fists anyway.""";negative
That is clearly emo!;positive
But what you don't understand is that GUNS are FAR range;negative
I can't believe you would find humor in my argument.;negative
Never did I ever say that.;negative
I'm saying people have killed each other since the beginning of time.;neutral
How dumb are you?;negative
You are pulling things out of your ass.;neutral
"Let me give you an idea of what an ""emo"" is.";positive
An emo is someone who is in a emotional disorder state.;negative
"""Emos"", are usually seen as depressed and on the verge of suicide.";negative
Therefore, most of them have signs showing they are about to commit suicide like cutting themselves, wanting to be isolated, angry or irritated, etc..;negative
.;neutral
I said that I would rather die quickly then dieing slowly.;negative
YOU are the one sounding like an emo every time I read your posts.;negative
Depends.;neutral
A handgun is good for a hundred yards or so.;positive
Shooting further then that and expecting to hit your target is almost impossible.;neutral
Now if you are talking about a hunting rifle, they can reach for hundreds of yards depending on what type of rifle it is.;negative
Most crime is done with a handgun from point blank range.;negative
Oh, I didn't find the argument to be funny at all.;negative
I'm laughing at your ignorance.;positive
I don't see how the fact that people have been killing in the past have anything to do with not banning gun control...;negative
I mean you seem emo.;neutral
You have this hopeless attitude towards death.;negative
What you have said sounded emo... about dying quickly.;neutral
You could actually get up and start defending yourself- with other people around that could help- without fear as no firearm was involved.;negative
If this circumstance occurred where firearms were not included, MORE lives would be saved!;negative
So... definitely kills better than fists... not to mention rapid fire...;negative
We would be literally saving LIVES if we reduced firearm access!;negative
I'm not the ignorant one here... I'm actually the one who wants to save lives...;negative
First of all, you can't tell who a person is by just reading their comments.;negative
Secondly, I do not have a hopless attitude towards death.;negative
Death is a terrible thing and I wish there was no such thing.;negative
However, we have it.;neutral
So we have to deal with it.;neutral
So I believe you would rather die slowly?;negative
I don't know anyone that would.;negative
Yes, I wish everyone would man up and fight with fists.;negative
I knew a few people that got beaten to death though.;negative
Sad that they have to live through that until they died.;negative
Firearms will always exist, in the wrong and/or right hands.;negative
Alright, I meant to say this in my first post.;neutral
Criminals will always have guns.;positive
Leagally or illegally.;neutral
Yes, it will make it harder to get guns, but when they have them who is going to stop them?;neutral
Yes, the police will come, but they will be taking a picture of your dead body when they do.;neutral
"On the ""rapid fire"" part.";positive
In the US, it's illegal to have a automatic weapon without a permit of some sort.;negative
Handguns legal in the US can only shoot as fast as you pull the trigger.;negative
Have your ever shot a gun really fast?;neutral
It's really hard to keep it on target.;negative
Actually, statistics shows that a well armed community has low crime rates.;negative
Trust me, if I were a criminal, I would think twice before going into their homes knowing they might have a gun.;negative
Let me tell you a true story.;positive
My Grandpa was fishing one night on the lake.;neutral
He always loved to fish.;positive
One night, he was checking his lines when a couple of men approached him.;negative
They were trying to talk to him as they were walking up.;neutral
Soon, one of them got too close and he told them to leave and find another fishing hole.;negative
They didn't.;neutral
One man picked up a rock and walked up behind him.;positive
My grandpa heard him and turned around with a 12 guage.;neutral
The man frozed.;neutral
The man has a rock and was about to bust my grandpa across the head.;neutral
This isn't uncommon.;negative
Many people have been knocked cold, mugged, and their bodys thrown into the river.;negative
"After a long silence, the man spoke up and said, ""he has a gun"".";negative
The men backed off, got into their truck, and droved off.;positive
If my grandpa didn't have that gun, he wouldn't be here today.;negative
It might seem you want to save people's lives.;negative
But you don't think what would happen if gun control was in place.;neutral
Here in the U.S., we are allowed to be armed under the second amendment.;negative
We are armed for one reason.;neutral
To keep the goverment at bay.;neutral
Thats what our founding fathers said.;neutral
To keep the goverment at bay.;neutral
Look down history where guns have been abolished.;negative
Usually, a massacare happens or the goverment becomes so strong that the people have no say.;negative
There is a whole bigger picture then what we have been discussing.;positive
I said you seem like an emo.;negative
Here's a quote from your previous argument: I'm against gun control.;negative
People since the beginning of time have killed people.;neutral
It will continue too.;positive
People can kill others by their bare hands.;neutral
Why ban guns when it won't solve the problem.;negative
How hopeless is that?!;negative
You are against the removal of a highly efficient murder-weapon;negative
Fists are avoidable.;neutral
You could run at any time...;neutral
Also, gun wounds, hurt like hell.;negative
Worse.;neutral
And I'd better have my chances in hospital with punch-wounds instead of bullet wounds.;negative
I've known a person who was shot in the stomach, along with thousands of stories about gangs, and driveby shooting.;neutral
Have you not even considered the school shootings?;negative
Being beaten up takes a while you know... and you'd get over it in hospital to recover and live your life.;neutral
... the wars between guns and melee weapons (Native indian against guns) ALWAYS ended with the death of the side that had no guns.;negative
You are brazenly incorrect.;negative
When people/security come, they will run and separate the two.;neutral
With guns, it would be more of police taking pictures of your dead body.;negative
Care to show me those statistics?;neutral
In Australia (where guns are illegal) we seem to have a considerably lower murder rate than all the gun wielding countries.;negative
And about the anecdote of your grandfather, those situations do not happen as virulently as school shootings and town massacres.;negative
Your grandpa may have survived but the hundreds of children who were shot dead in the multiple school shootings that occurred due to access of firearms, and the hostage situations involving guns could of been stopped, had guns not been easy to obtain.;negative
As said before, you can't judge me when you don't even know me.;negative
Get off the emo crap.;negative
It is sad, but it's the truth.;neutral
You cannot deny that.;negative
A gun is not a murder weapon.;negative
It is also used in hunting and shooting competitions.;negative
"However, since you want to elaborate on a ""murder weapon"", as said before, criminals will ALWAYS get their hands on a weapon or gun somehow.";neutral
Gun control isn't going to solve anything.;negative
Have you ever seen someone get jumped?;neutral
It happens so fast you don't have time to react.;negative
Usually, it is with a group of people too.;negative
As said before, criminals will always get weapons.;negative
Gun wounds do hurt like hell.;negative
But if someone was going to pick a fight with me, I'm going to tell them straight up.;negative
If they continue with that I'm going to take every right ot defend myself.;positive
It's not what you think.;negative
Here in the US no one just walks up and shoots the other guy.;neutral
It happens for a reason.;neutral
Just like a fight happens for a reason.;neutral
It's not at random.;negative
Here in the US it has changed.;neutral
Most big schools that occurs in now requires you to go through security checks.;negative
Most schools now have a lot of police officers with tasers and sometimes lethal weapons.;neutral
These school shooting could easily been stop by this.;negative
Sadly, the didn't react fast enough.;negative
Not when you die from it.;negative
Thats were I'm getting at.;neutral
Thats another thing I touched on.;positive
As said a hundred times, criminals will always gets guns.;positive
Taking away weapons from law abiding citizens will only get them killed in the end.;negative
Gun control solves nothing.;negative
And why are you bringing up war?;negative
Military will not follow gun control.;negative
When someone bursts into your house they WILL kill you.;negative
What are you talking about?;neutral
Read the comment again.;negative
It seems like you skipped over most of my post.;negative
Re read it.;neutral
Sure, why not.;negative
However, this site will destroy what you have said.;neutral
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1083303/posts;neutral
Mugging happens ALL THE TIME!;neutral
Massacares are done usually by a country that has gun control.;negative
Search some facts and get back to me if you would like to debate on the massacare thing.;negative
should fire arms be banned?;negative
Yes, the fire arms should be banned.;negative
But if they are banned then it would not be legal for anyone to have them.So, even the police can't have them.;negative
Whereas the terrorists will have them even if it is illegal.That will create a big problem.;negative
Herein lies one of my biggest contentions regarding the gun control debate.;neutral
Yeah, I thought that was hilarious.;positive
Dont you believe in the right to bear arms?;positive
to protect yourself.;neutral
"Making firearms illegal only stops law abiding citizens from having them; not only that but you give rise to a black market for firearms where criminals benefit even more when they increase the price and profit considerably.";negative
Comparing it to drug prohibition if I may, drugs are still being obtained and used, the only difference is that the black market regulates the distribution and gains the profit.;negative
Some drug users, if not most, are not terrible degenerates wasting their life away.;negative
Some of them are just regular people who like to get high occasionally.;neutral
The law still labels them as criminals.;neutral
Same with gun ownership.;neutral
Some, if not most, are not murderers, thieves, or gang members.;negative
Some are just regular people who like to hunt, collect, or just shoot at a range occasionally.;negative
Let’s not let the law label these people as criminals.;negative
"Let it be known: Making guns illegal will NOT make them go away; it will only disarm the lawful.";negative
Whereas the terrorists will have them even if it is illegal.That will create a big problem;negative
Do you know that when criminals who had been arrested for Breaking and Entering were asked if they were afraid of homeowners with guns, the majority of the criminals responded no?;negative
The criminals weren't afraid because they all believed that if they were ever confronted by a gun wielding homeowner, the normal law-abiding citizen would hesitate while the criminals would pull their own guns and shoot first.;negative
People constantly trumpet about how having a gun means that they can protect themselves, but first they must be able to fire the gun on another human being, something that most people find hard to do.;positive
Really protecting yourself with a gun isn't very much protection at all, meanwhile the abundance and attainability of guns means dangerous people can easily get a hold of a dangerous weapon.;negative
That could have been because 1) they were on drugs at the time, and didn't have their senses with them 2) most homeowner don't have guns anymore 3) they were scared shitless, but they didn't admit it because it would make them look like a pansy.;negative
There could be many more reasons other than:;neutral
In fact, most armed homeowners, when faced with an intruder, are able to kill it or hold it for police without much trouble because they are far better oriented with their home than the intruder.;negative
They also have much better mental faculties.;negative
Not when it's a life or death situation.;neutral
You can't know until you've been in one.;negative
the abundance and attainability of weapons also work to the advantage of the law abider.;negative
You have much better chances when you can defend yourself.;neutral
It is now 2015 and the terrible gun violence continues to increase.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-19/american-gun-deaths-to-exceed-traffic-fatalities-by-2015;neutral
I don't think that should have guns because if a really dumb desperate drug attic really wanted some drugs or money they would definately buy a gun,(or steal it) and find some houses to break into then try and find money.;negative
If they see somebody in that house then they would definatley shoot them cold-blooded.;negative
Then they would keep the pursuit and kill many other people.;neutral
That is if they do not get caught.;negative
If there is gun control there would be less crime.Drug lords will not be able to sell drugs.;negative
There will be less people in jail for murder .;negative
They can still use knives though.;negative
Some reasons why we shouldn't have guns is because if we didn't then many other kids would not be exposed to to the guns and that way if the guns are gone then the children won't shoot their selves or each other.;negative
Because if a parent has a gun in the house and the child see's where the parent put it they are going to want and invite their =little friends over and wanting to show them.;negative
So when he/she shows their friends they might get shot or shoot them by accident.;negative
Or even on purpose.;neutral
We shouldn't have guns because it kills many people in the world.;negative
It is very violent and MANY people loose their lives using them.;negative
Also they get locked up for the rest of their lives if they shoot, kill, or even not have a liscense for it.;negative
some people should not shoot guns.They don't even know how to keep the gun from smashing there face in.;negative
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5ZlwvujpAA;neutral
if there was no guns in the world there would be know war...maybe.Guns cause violence and destruction.We even bimbed china during the war.Maybe they deserved it.;negative
But gun control won't get rid of the guns.;negative
Does prohibition get rid of drugs?;negative
Even if we do eradicate them, people will just use some other efficient device like nukes to mass murder eachother;negative
the 2nd amendment states that we can bear arms to protect ourselves.if that is changed then what would I do with my desert eagle;neutral
I think people should be able to carry guns for many reasons.;neutral
I think that because most cities and neighborhoods are very dangerous.;negative
So if you were just at a red light or somthing then somebody runs up on you and tries to car jack you or watever with a gun you should be able to have a gun and atleast shoot that person in the arm or somthing so that you won't get killed.;negative
That way if you shoot them in the arm they would probably, well they should have a chance to live but if they shoot you in the head or chest you might die because that is more severe.;negative
It is very dangerous around here and people need to protect theirselves.;negative
people in the army need guns to protect themselves.If they did not have guns in the military ,we would suck.;negative
all of our troops would be dead.without rocket launchers we would be bombed.;negative
I also think that we should have guns because if the police doesn't have any weapons or anything for defence then all the criminals would get away.;negative
!;neutral
It would be ore dangerous without guns than it is if we did not have guns.;negative
Well, in Switzerland everyone has full auto assault weapons and there is almost no crime.;negative
In Mexico, almost everything is illegal and just look at their murder rates.;negative
In my opinion, crime is caused by poverty and drug addiction, not guns.;negative
If we get rid of poverty and drugs, there will be no more problem.;negative
Gun control just makes it worse because criminals can still buy their guns illegally but responsible citizens can't and are totally defenseless.;negative
Also, if the guns are gone, it makes it easier for people like Hitler to take control over the government and genocide people.;negative
Nowadays people just think the cops will protect them, but what if they go away or become bad.;negative
"I call people with that mentality, ""sheep"".";neutral
It's not about removing guns completely its about making gun control laws more stringent so that tragedies like the recent one in Arizona are avoided.;negative
If people weren't allowed to simply walk into a gun show and purchase a weapon with no background check, if people were required to have a license it becomes more difficult for criminals and for people who intend to misuse their guns, to acquire them, while still allowing for law abiding citizens to own and buy guns.;negative
I love shooting.;neutral
I'm not really knowledgeable on guns, but give me almost any rifle and a target and I'm good.;negative
Guns are used recreationally.;neutral
It's safer with them.;neutral
And if they were banned think of all the pissed off rednecks we'd have to deal with.;negative
"gun control means that you should use both hands when you fire your gun ;)";neutral
The NRA says that we should have guns.they pay a lot of money to keep guns around.if there is gun control they will have no busines.I support the NRA to keep them in business and to keep gun around.;negative
Do you know that when criminals who had been arrested for Breaking and Entering were asked if they were afraid of homeowners with guns, the majority of the criminals responded no?;negative
The criminals weren't afraid because they all believed that if they were ever confronted by a gun wielding homeowner, the normal law-abiding citizen would hesitate while the criminals would pull their own guns and shoot first.;negative

should guns in america be legal.;neutral
Not just is the gun in America a symbol of defense, but also one of liberty and freedom.;positive

Without this one power-checker, there can be almost no power in the hands of the proletariat against our increasingly totalitarian government.;negative
they are yoused as self defence and what happens if someone robbes you with a gun do you just hit them with a bat?;neutral
><;neutral
If a real criminal was robbing you with a gun, dirty hairy as you may think you are, the second you pulled your own gun they would kill you.;negative
Best to give them the wallet and call the cops later.;positive
Not if your faster and have you seen the stupid way gangsters hold guns in this country I'll take my chances;negative
Of course, we cannot protect our selves!;negative
"America has one of the highest crime crates in the world and people says that guns are ""evil.""";neutral
That is absurd and illogical to not have a gun in the United States.;negative
America has one of the highest crime rates in the world;neutral
This is because of the right to bear arms...;positive
You know even if guns are illegal criminals arn't going to care;negative
I don't think there's a correlation there.;neutral
Way too simplistic.;negative
Hate to sound like a redneck but hell yea we need guns here.;negative
Knowing that police and military are the only ones with guns in no way makes me feel safe.;negative
The first thing every dictator does is take away the guns.;neutral
If I want to kill someone and all I've got is a pencil then I guess that'll have to do.;negative
It's human nature and tyrannical laws won't make us any nicer, just more psychotic.;neutral
P.S. I don't wanna hurt nobody.;negative
Absolutely!;neutral
Why would anyone in any country ever want to be unarmed when the government and criminals have them.;negative
I think that if a person or a society puts themselves in that position they deserve to and WILL be oppressed.;negative

No one deserves to be oppressed.;negative
"That's just douche baggery (I'm coining that phrase, like buggery, but baggery being preceded by ""douche"").";negative
2.;neutral
I don't have a gun, and I'm not oppressed at all.;negative
Arguably I'm less oppressed than most.;negative
I don't own one either but the day someone tells me I cant is the day I get one and kill anyone who tries to take it away.;negative
Ah, the old angry insane gun nut mentality.;neutral
Kill anyone who takes my gun... uh, even though I don't have a gun.;negative
Do you feel this is a normal reaction?;neutral
Are you telling me that if the government (or anyone for that matter) told you that you couldn't have a gun, they could but you couldn't weather you wanted one or not, you wouldn't be angry?;negative
I don't need someone telling me that I cant defend my self and my family the way i find appropriate.;negative
The day someone tells me that I'm supposed to fight off robbers, rapists or child abductors with a knife, and some mace only is the day that person and whoever they represent becomes my enemy and my oppressor and I'm not just gunna let them do it.;negative
Yes i don't own a gun but my husband does and if he didn't then I would own one.;negative
There are people around the world living in fear of their government and extremest.;neutral
Worried that any day at any time someone could come and take everything they have and everyone they love and they wont be able to stop them because all they have are rocks and sticks for weapons.;positive
I known that we are lucky in this country, that reality doesn't exist in our daily lives but it could and the first steps towards it is taking away our ability to stop it.;positive
I phrased my previous statement the way I did to get a reaction but it doesn't mean its not true.;negative
Meh,;neutral
1.;neutral
I suppose if we're talking dreamworld where someone is actually trying to take guns away from law abiding citizens for some nefarious reason, okay kinda;neutral
I notice a false storyline where people pretend legislation to ensure an AK is only sold after a background check and where any dissent to laws like stand your ground are met with wild-eyed predictions of some coming Apocalypse.;negative
So that's kinda the atmosphere I'm replying from.;negative
2.;neutral
Most have a better chance of surviving any robbery or the like, where the perpetrator has a gun, by not trying to pull one them self.;negative
Despite all of our imaginings otherwise, very few of us are Dirty Hairy.;negative
3.;neutral
Of course I'm a ninja, so I don't need one anyway :p;negative
What's the point of this debate people are just gonna.;negative
Rake the laws anyway;neutral
Sure, but really there should be more extensive tests and trials before giving any random person a gun.;negative
I don't trust people as much as some do.;negative
Not that I don't trust people at all, just that considering the circumstances and events that have happened oh since the birth of America, I have my reasons to not trust every American, why should I?;negative
"So really this is about trust, rather that potentiality of ""guns in america"".";negative
At the top of my head I cannot think of regulations and/or tests that should be given in more extent before handing a person a weapon for no good reason.;negative
I live in Australia and no one except mainly the police have guns...;neutral
And we're doing just fine.;negative
Of course there are some ways where criminals could get their hands on em, but that is uncommon.;negative

Oh, and the coppers mostly use ranged tazerguns instead of bullet spewing weapons.;negative
I live in Norway, where not even the police are allowed to openly carry firearms.;negative
Violent crime is almost non-existent because the means to commit them are sparse.;negative
I guess it does have something to do with the public mindset too, though.;negative

please debate on either side to support our debate.;positive
it would be interesting to see what people think about this matter.;positive
with everyones thoughts we will use this for a future debate not on this site.;positive
if you do debate, please state why and if you think some arangment should be met inbetween!;positive
thanks and i hope that lots of you debate!;positive
this is for you!Tongue Out;neutral
If the guns have a useful purpose, then yes.;negative
Otherwise, why would you have the government support a culture of violence?;negative
Ideally, there is no reason to carry firearms, and there is no demand in the black market.;negative
If this can't be achieved then selling legally is a good temporary fix.;negative
Yea, i agree, they should only be sold in dark alleys on the black market to all sorts of criminals who would still be able to buy them, and then the people who abide by the law will have no guns to protect themselves from criminals because theyre not familiar with this type of purchasing.;negative
"Now see, me, i like to have a little fun on the ""dark side"" so id buy myself a gun for self protection, i bet i could get a great deal on the streets";positive
yes, this is a good point, although i think they should not be sold in dark alleys for criminals, just for the military forces and police;positive
Well see thats the point: theres always going to be an illegal market for things that are illegal.;negative
Only allowing armed forces to have guns would be terrible and if that happened there would be a massive power split and civilization would fall to pieces;negative
Even if we ban them, how can we make sure that people will not buy it from an arms dealer.;negative
Guns can easily transferred from the Mexican Border like drugs and people.;positive
These firearms are much more deadly.;negative
in the U.K. there are no guns sold over the counter.;negative
this means are crime rate is slightly lower then the U.S. i'm sure if you came and lived in the U.K. you would see what i mean.;negative
now imagine if no criminals could get hold of a gun, you wouldn't need a protection, as no criminals have guns.;negative
if no citizen had guns, just the forces who know how to properly use it, then we would need to guns for protection, just for war.;negative
if no guns can be sold over the counter, less are going to be sold, less are going to be made, and we will be saving millions.;negative
not to also be saving materials for what we really need.;negative
special modified guns could be given to animal hunters and fishermen, maybe so they only work on certain animals, so they wouldn't be able to kill anything other then that animal.;negative
but imagine, if not so many animals were killed with guns, those animals have a right to live.;negative
selling guns over the counter means that ANYONE can have guns to just display, kill animals or 'protect themselves'.;positive
think like the U.K. snd you will soon see what i mean.....;neutral
and if you are not a women, or more, still in school, change how you think for this debate, and think how i think, and debate.;negative
NO GUSN SHOUDL BE SOLD OVER THE COUNTER IN AMERICA.;negative
SEE THE U.K.'S CRIME RATE GO DOWN!;negative
Can you explain how then will the American people will the firearms and may I ask would this be considered unconstitutional by the 2nd amendment.;neutral
still, i don't get what you mean by 2nd amendment.;negative
THE POINT IS THEY DO NOT GET GUNS.;negative
ANYOEN CAUGHT WITH GUNS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SHOW VALID PROOF THAT THEY CAN BE ARMED WITH A GUN WOUDL BE SENT TO PRISON, OR WORSE, FOR LIFE/KILLED.;negative
YOU GET IT NOW????;neutral

Selling guns over the counter is dumb!;negative
There is too much gun violence in America.;negative
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015.;neutral
It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.;negative
An estimated 33,000 Americans will lose their lives from guns as opposed to an estimated 32,000 Americans who will die in car accidents.;negative
The gun violence in America is an American Shame!;neutral

First of all i believe it is the right of the state not the federal government to decide how to administer the firearms.;negative
If the guns cause crime to go up the state should decide what to do.;negative
Secondly i believe they can be given over the counter but not be given that same day, to check their background;negative
imagine you had to make the decision, what would you chose?;neutral
i don't get what you mean in your second point, could you clarify?;negative
here in the U.K. we think very differently.;neutral
here nobody would say they could be sold over the counter.;negative
i think if you thought from this perspective you would agree.;neutral
My second thought says that i think they can not buy a gun that same day.;neutral
Like they come in and so the owner will have time to look for a criminal background.;neutral
In like 3 days, they can come in and buy that firearm over the counter.;negative
The level of gun control is up to the States so long as they do not ban guns.;negative
If a state wishes to make it that guns can be sold over the counter without even a license or permit, it is their Constitutional right.;positive
well, imagine you were the person making the decision, what would you chose?;positive
Personally I am for elimination of most government powers, so the ability to regulate gun trade would be little to none.;negative
Sold over the counter?;neutral
Absolutely.;neutral
the right to own a gun is one of our most basic freedoms here in the U.S. Criminals are not the only people that own guns.;negative
it isnt the gun that kills people, its the person that makes the stupid decision to pull the trigger.;negative
owning guns also allows us to protect ourselves.;positive
even if we did outlaw guns.;neutral
criminals would still get a hold of guns illegally.;negative
the only difference would be that citizens would not be able to protect themselves;negative
How would people get guns to go duck hunting?;neutral
well, first, they wouldn't.;positive
you are killling harmless creatures.;positive
and if you had to you coudl have a special shop selling animal guns.;neutral
then how would they be sold?;neutral
they wouldn't.;neutral
that is the point.;neutral
you could not buy a gun unless you had like a special license.;negative
only navy/force or police woudl be able to get them.;negative
Understand the 2nd ammendment.;neutral
One of our basic rights as Americans is the Right to Bear Arms.;negative
This isn't just so we can own guns to hunt with and protect ourselves, but to also protect from a tyrannical government.;negative
If the government and armed forces were only those with arms, who will protect citizens when the government is tyrannical?;neutral
Don't think for a second it can't happen here in the US.;neutral
It already is.;neutral
Yes Private property or not i do beileve we should be able to carry anywhere.....why?;neutral
Because well in my case the Indiana State Police Department has deamed me capable of carring a hand gun.;neutral
Not that their killing machines, but property rights are part of individual rights.;negative
You have a right to carry a gun, but if an owner of property asks you to leave because of your weapon, you must leave.;negative
It is not up to you what goes on on someone else's private property.;negative
Public sector, however, should be fully open to the carrying of firearms.;negative
I think it is a dangerous concept to allow people with guns in business establishments.;neutral
